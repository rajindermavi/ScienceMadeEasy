We will use most of the basic tools from . However, for the purpose of this paper one would need a refined version of finite scale localization, beyond what is achieved in that paper. We analyze the spectrum of the operator $H_N(x)$, $x\\in {\\mathbb T}^d$, on a finite interval $[1,N]$ subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions. To keep this spectrum under control requires resolving the following problem. Given $E$ let $\\mathcal{R}_N(E)$ be the set of all phases $x$ such that $E$ is in the spectrum of the operator $H_N(x)$. One has to identify phases $x\\in \\mathcal{R}_N(E)$ for which $x+n\\omega$ is not too close to $\\mathcal{R}_N(E)$ as $n$ runs in the interval $N\\ll n< N^A$, $A\\gg 1$. This issue, commonly referred to as *double resonances*, is well-known. Similar strategies, leading to the formation of intervals in the spectrum, have been implemented for the skew-shift in  and for continuous two-dimensional Schrödinger operators in . The main new device that we develop in this work, consists of an elimination of double resonances for *all* shifts $x+h$, and not just the “arithmetic ones” $x+n\\omega$. Of course the shift $h$ cannot be too small. Although this problem looks less accessible, it turns out to provide more control on the resonant set $\\mathcal{R}_N(E)$ of the previous scale. The level sets $V(x)=E$ of the potential in question must satisfy the requirements of this more general elimination in order to launch the multi-scale analysis.

Our motivations are as follows. First of all, in Refs. , it was shown that $U_{\\text{ORDKR}}$ and $U_{\\text{KHM}}$ have different spectra if $\\hbar$ is a rational multiple of $2\\pi$. On the other hand, as $\\hbar/(2\\pi)$ approaches an arbitrary irrational number, the spectral difference between $U_{\\text{ORDKR}}$ and $U_{\\text{KHM}}$, which is characterized by a Hausdorff metric in Ref. , was shown to approach zero. It is therefore highly worthwhile looking into the actual spectral differences for rational values of $\\hbar/(2\\pi)$, because, up to a classical canonical transformation, ORDKR and KHM have exactly the same classical limit  (obtained by letting $\\hbar$ approach zero while fixing $K/\\hbar$ and $L/\\hbar$). Indeed, given their equivalence in the classical limit, the spectral differences we analyze constitute beautiful examples to illustrate how quantization of classically equivalent systems may lead to remarkable system-specific consequences. Second, by working on the details we hope to find some clues as to why the dynamics of ORDKR can be so different from that of KHM. We indeed succeed in doing this, finding that even on a qualitative level, the Floquet bands of ORDKR behave much differently from that of KHM, for $\\hbar=2\\pi M/N$, with $M$ and $N$ being coprime and both odd. In particular, we shall prove the existence of a flat Floquet band for ORDKR with $K=L$, which may be of interest to current studies of strongly correlated condensed-matter systems with an almost flat energy band . The existence of a flat Floquet band has been shown elsewhere to be important in explaining the intriguing exponential quantum spreading dynamics in ORDKR . Third, motivated by recent interests in topological characterization of periodically driven systems  and given the interesting relationship of the two models described previously, we ask whether, after all, ORDKR and KHM have any interesting topological connections. Based on our numerical and analytical studies, the answer is yes and we shall claim that ORDKR and KHM are topologically equivalent in the sense that their extended Floquet bands (obtained upon introducing a phase shift parameter defined in Sec. III) always have the same band Chern numbers.\n\nThis paper is organized in the following order. In Sec. II we present detailed results regarding a spectral comparison between KHM and ORDKR, for $K=L$, and $\\hbar=2\\pi M/N$ with $M$ and $N$ being coprime and odd integers. Numerical findings will be described first, followed by analytical considerations when possible (e.g., band width scaling for a three-band case and the general proof of a flat band for ORDKR). The implications of peculiar spectral properties of ORDKR for its dynamics are also discussed via some numerical studies.

{"chunk_id": "2109.13933v1::L63-70::c2", "text": "Introduction Quasi-periodic systems have been heavily studied in recent years in many contexts, i.e. twisted bi-layer systems, incommensurate Floquet Hamiltonians, localization transitions in 1D, and virtural topological invariants.\nNew quasi-periodic models have been proposed in each of these contexts, prompting many numerical pursuits in search of metal insulator transitions, novel topological phases, and 1D mobility edges. However, quasi-periodic systems are notoriously difficult to simulate, with many numerical and even some analytic results failing to capture the full behavior of these regular aperiodic systems. Beyond the fundamental challenges of exploring phase transitions, quasi-periodic systems are impossible to exactly simulate due to the infinite period of a quasi-periodic potential, and approximations are very sensitive to boundary conditions - in-gap edge modes can arise. This letter presents an alternative approach resting on the approximation of quasi-periodic transfer matrices via a continued fraction sequence of higher dimensional rational projected Green's functions. Our approach both provides a measure of numerical accuracy (explicit finite size convergence conditions) and circumvents the definition of boundary conditions by resting on projected Green's function (pGf) technology, a tool from translation-invariant systems defined by the bulk Green's function and carrying boundary information.\n\nThe paradigmatic quasi-periodic system is the 1D Andre-Aubry-Harper (AAH) Model (almost-Mathieu operator in the math community). Famous for its sharp 1D metal insulator transition (MIT), self-duality, and mapping to a 2D Hofstadter Hamiltonian, the AAH model is an important benchmark for any tool - many current methods fail to find a complete phase diagram. We therefore construct our formalism in relation to the AAH model and then address generalizations to other 1D quasi-periodic models, self-dual and beyond. Higher dimensions follow naturally, but are left to future work. This letter proceeds by introducing rational approximates to quasi-periodic operators, constructing a transfer matrix equation (TME) for each rational approximate, detailing a convergence criteria for these rational TME approximates, extracting the spatial properties of quasi-periodic eigenfunctions from the aforementioned criteria, and finally, showcasing a few generalizations beyond the AAH model afforded by our approach.\n\nRational Approximates\nQuasi-periodic  systems can be readily analyzed with sequences of rational approximates. These are linear operators whose quasi-periodic  parameter,  is replaced by a rational parameter  such that . The fastest converging sequence is the continued fraction approximation for , i.e. . We can choose\n\nDifferent irrational numbers have different rational approximates whose convergence properties can be vastly different.

The present paper accomplishes precisely this task for CMV operators in the presence of suitable reflection symmetries by synthesizing ideas of to exploit gauge-invariance in order to implement the approach of Jitomirskaya-Simon. The main results of this work in particular show that several localization results recently obtained for the unitary almost-Mathieu operator and mosaic model are sharp in the sense that localization for almost every phase cannot be strengthened to localization for all phases. Furthermore, the method gives generic absence of eigenvalues for CMV matrices and quantum walks generated by subshifts containing many palindromes.  In particular, we obtain the first results on singular continuous spectrum for CMV matrices generated by the Thue-Morse subshift, to our knowledge.\n\nLet us briefly recall some of the background literature. In the setting of self-adjoint operators Jitomirskaya-Simon gave a criterion for Schrodinger operators to have purely continuous spectrum. This was adapted to palindromic subshift operators by Hof-Knill-Simon and developed further in works such as Koslover and Jitomirskaya-Liu.\nAs was noted in, arguments based on reflections to be more delicate (even outright impossible) for standard CMV operators, due to a lack of appropriate reflection symmetries. However, the authors and collaborators observed in that one can overcome this by passing to the setting of so-called generalized CMV matrices via complexification and relating the complexified CMV matrix to the initial operator via a diagonal gauge transformation that preserves the Verblunsky coefficients. Let us also mention a different obstruction to localization, known as the Gordon criterion, is based on the presence of suitable repetitions, rather than reflections. This is significantly more straightforward and has already been worked out for CMV matrices in; see also for an arithmetic strengthening and for earlier results. Recently, Avila and Damanik have announced another approach to delocalization that applies to ergodic self-adjoint operators in arbitrary dimensions.\nCMV matrices have physical significance, as they are (equivalent to) one-dimensional split-step quantum walks, which was first observed in and elaborated upon in. Split-step quantum walks are the simplest type of the rich class of quantum walks which have gained popularity in recent years as models of discrete time quantum dynamics.

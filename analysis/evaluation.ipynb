The Aubry-Andre conjecture stated that the measure of the spectrum of $H_{\\\\alpha,\\\\theta,\\\\lambda}$ is equal to $4|1-|\\\\lambda||,$ so to $0$ if $\\\\lambda=1,$ for any irrational $\\\\alpha.$ This conjecture was popularized by B. Simon, first in his list of 15 problems in mathematical physics and then, after it was proved by Last for a.e. $\\\\alpha$ , again as Problem 5 in , which was to prove this conjecture for the remaining measure zero set of $\\\\alpha$, namely, for $\\\\alpha$ of bounded type.[^4] The arguments of did not work for this set, and even though the semi-classical analysis of Helffer-Sjöstrand applied to some of this set for $H_{\\\\alpha,\\\\theta}$, it did not apply to other such $\\\\alpha$, including, most notably, the golden mean — the subject of most numerical investigations. For the non-critical case, the proof for all $\\\\alpha$ of bounded type was given in , but the critical “bounded-type” case remained difficult to crack. This remaining problem for zero measure of the spectrum of $H_{\\\\alpha,\\\\theta}$ was finally solved by Avila-Krikorian , who employed a deep dynamical argument. We note that the argument of worked not for all $\\\\alpha,$ but for a full measure subset of Diophantine $\\\\alpha$. In the present paper, we provide a very simple argument that recovers this theorem and thus gives an elementary solution to Problem 5 of . Moreover, our argument works simultaneously for all irrational $\\\\alpha$.\\n\\n<div id=\"zero\" class=\"theorem\">\\n\\n**Theorem 2**. *For any irrational $\\\\alpha$ and real $\\\\theta$, $|\\\\sigma(H_{\\\\alpha,\\\\theta})|=0.$*\\n\\n</div>',\n",

In fact, all we need is a much weaker statement: the existence of at least one miss in sublinear time, which of course follows from the sublinear bound. We make some explicit estimates on the power used in the sublinear bound (<a href=\"#DiscBound\" data-reference-type=\"eqref\" data-reference=\"DiscBound\">[DiscBound]</a>) in Section <a href=\"#section:SA\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"section:SA\">4</a>. The sublinear bound was also fruitfully used in a recent work to establish vanishing of transport exponents $\\\\beta(p)$ (thus subpolynomial bounds on the moment growth) for long-range quasiperiodic operators, for which the authors of developed a non-transfer-matrix based approach. It is an interesting question whether power-logarithmic bounds can be also obtained in that case.\\n\\nWe cover all scenarios where a.e. Anderson localization has been proved for one-dimensional operators with analytic quasiperiodic and skew-shift potentials as described in Bourgain’s book and with Gevrey extensions in . For all these models the a.e. dynamical localization was also shown to hold . Essentially, what we demonstrate by this work is that power-logarithmic bounds on transport can be viewed as *dynamical localization-light*, since the proof is considerably simpler than that of localization and in fact can be obtained in many known scenarios as a part of the latter proof. Yet the results are phase-stable and presumably optimal as far as phase-stable results go. Just as with Anderson localization, our theorems are non-perturbative (obtained as a corollary of positive Lyapunov exponents) for analytic potentials over toral shifts and Gevrey potentials for one-frequency shifts, while they require large coupling constants dependent on the frequency for the multifrequency Gevrey and skew shift cases. We note however, that all such dependence comes from the large deviation estimates that we use as a black box; we don’t add any further “perturbative” components through our technique.\\n\\nWe proceed to formulate our main results. Consider the time-averaged quantity: $$a(n,t) = \\\\frac 2 T \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{2t/T}\\\\frac 12 \\\\left(\\\\left|\\\\left\\\\langle e^{itH_{\\\\omega, x}} \\\\delta_0, \\\\delta_n \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\right|^2 + \\\\left|\\\\left\\\\langle e^{itH_{\\\\omega, x}} \\\\delta_1, \\\\delta_n \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\right|^2 \\\\right) dt,$$ where $\\\\delta_n(m) = 1$ when $m = n$ and 0 otherwise.\\n\\nDynamical localization is characterized by boundedness in time of the moments of the position operator:',\n",

       "  'text': \"Another motivation comes from two important topics in spectral theory: mobility edges and localization with fixed frequency. One of the most notable phenomena in spectral theory is the spectral phase transition between absolutely continuous and pure point spectral types as one varies a parameter within a given system. A significant instance of this phase transition occurs when several spectral types coexist simultaneously for the same operator, that is, the phase transition happens in the *energy*. On account of the RAGE theorem, the quantum dynamics in the pure point part of the spectrum is localized whereas the dynamics in the absolutely continuous part of the spectrum exhibits transport in a suitable sense . Thus, one refers to an energy separating pure point and absolutely continuous spectral regimes as a *mobility edge*. Proving the existence of a mobility edge for multidimensional random operators remains a serious open problem in spectral theory and mathematical physics (compare ). One of the most important families in which spectral phase transitions have been observed is the *almost-Mathieu operator* $$(H_{ V,\\\\alpha,\\\\theta}\\\\,u)(n)=u(n+1)+u(n-1)+ V (n\\\\alpha+\\\\theta)u(n),$$ where $V(x)=2\\\\lambda \\\\cos 2\\\\pi x$ for $x \\\\in {\\\\mathbb{T}}:={\\\\mathbb{R}}/{\\\\mathbb{Z}}$. The almost-Mathieu operator is known to exhibit phase transitions as the relevant parameters (coupling constant, frequency and phase) are varied . Furthermore, the mosaic almost-Mathieu operator and the “generalized” André-Aubry model display exact mobility edges . Spectral phase transitions have been observed lately also in the *unitary almost-Mathieu operator* (UAMO) , which is defined as the GECMV matrix with Verblunsky coefficients $$\\\\begin{aligned}\\n        \\\\alpha_{2n-1} &= \\\\lambda_2 \\\\sin(2\\\\pi(n\\\\Phi+\\\\theta)),  & \\\\alpha_{2n} &= \\\\lambda_1',\\\\\\\\  \\n        \\\\rho_{2n-1} &=  \\\\lambda_2 \\\\cos(2\\\\pi(n\\\\Phi+\\\\theta)) - i \\\\lambda_2',   & \\\\rho_{2n} &= \\\\lambda_1,\\n\\n\\\\end{aligned}$$ where $\\\\lambda_i\\\\in[0,1]$ and $\\\\lambda_i'=\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\lambda_i^2}$. However, it is unknown whether there exist GECMV matrices and extended CMV matrices which have exact mobility edges.\\n\\nSpecifically, to establish the presence of mobility edges for extended CMV matrices, the key issue is to obtain Anderson localization for fixed frequency, since establishing the presence of purely absolutely continuous spectrum is well-developed for quasi-periodic extended CMV matrices . We should point out that in the Schrödinger case, Anderson localization for fixed frequency is quite an important issue in establishing the Ten Martini Problem , the universal hierarchical structure of eigenfunctions and the sharp arithmetic phase transition . In the quasi-periodic extended CMV setting and in the positive Lyapunov exponent regime, Anderson localization with fixed phase is given by Damanik-Wang (in the same spirit as in Bourgain-Goldstein ). However, it is still a major challenge to establish Anderson localization for fixed Diophantine frequency for general almost-periodic extended CMV matrices.[^1] Our main results give a profitable step forward and a new set of tools in this regard.\",\n",

On one hand, we consider in the regime of positive Lyapunov exponent. In �� Goldstein-Schlag proved Hölder continuity of the IDS for quasi-periodic Schrödinger operator with large analytic potential and Diophantine frequency. Later, Bourgain showed the IDS for almost Mathieu operator is $(\\\\frac{1}{2}-\\\\epsilon)$-Hölder continuous (for any small $\\\\epsilon>0$) if the coupling $\\\\lambda_2$ is small and the frequency is Diophantine. Recently, Tao-Voda dealt with quasi-periodic Jacobi operators and obtained especially that the IDS for EHM is $(\\\\frac{1}{2}-\\\\epsilon)$-Hölder continuous if the Lyapunov exponent is positive and the frequency is strong Diophantine. On the other hand, in the subcritical regime Amor proved that the IDS for Schrödinger operator with Diophantine frequency and small (in perturbative sense) analytic potential is $\\\\frac{1}{2}$-Hölder continuous. After that, Avila-Jitomirskaya got $\\\\frac{1}{2}$-Hölder continuity of the IDS for almost Mathieu operator for $\\\\lambda_2\\\\neq\\\\pm1$ and Diophantine frequency and they also obtained $\\\\frac{1}{2}$-Hölder continuity of the IDS for Schrödinger operator with small (in non-perturbative sense) analytic potential and Diophantine frequency. Subsequently, Avila-Jitomirskaya established $\\\\frac{1}{2}$-Hölder continuity of the spectral measures for Schrödinger operator with small analytic potential and Diophantine frequency. Note that all above mentioned results are in Diophantine frequency case and You-Zhang extended Goldstein-Schlag’s results to weak Liouville frequency case. In Liu-Yuan improved Avila-Jitomirskaya’s results to Liouville frequency case. In a recent work by Cai-Chavaudret-You-Zhou , they proved $\\\\frac{1}{2}$-Hölder continuity of the IDS for Schrödinger operator with small (perturbative) finitely differentiable potential and Diophantine frequency.',\n",

That is to say, there is to our knowledge no dictionary that explicitly connects properties of Schrödinger operators with CMV matrices or quantum walks in an explicit fashion.\\n\\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. We defined the model and state our results in Section\\xa0<a href=\"#sec:modelanddefs\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"sec:modelanddefs\">2</a>. Section\\xa0<a href=\"#sec:origins\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"sec:origins\">3</a> discusses the two-dimensional quantum walks from which the main model of the paper is derived. In Section\\xa0<a href=\"#sec:cocycle\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"sec:cocycle\">4</a>, we discuss the associated transfer matrix cocycle in detail, characterizing the cocycle dynamics according to Avila’s global theory in each parameter region. Section\\xa0<a href=\"#sec:aubry\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"sec:aubry\">5</a> discusses and proves several manifestations of Aubry duality for the model, which is then put to use in Sections\\xa0<a href=\"#sec:contspec\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"sec:contspec\">6</a>–<a href=\"#sec:localization\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"sec:localization\">8</a> to prove the remainder of our spectral results.',\n",

Harper used a tight-binding approximation now called the Harper model. The Schrödinger operator governing the spectrum of the Harper model is the almost Mathieu operator $H_{\\\\lambda,\\\\alpha,\\\\omega}$ with $\\\\lambda=1$. Physicists sought to better understand the topological structure of the spectrum $\\\\Sigma_{\\\\lambda,\\\\alpha,\\\\omega}$ of $H_{\\\\lambda,\\\\alpha,\\\\omega}$. M.\\xa0Azbel in 1964 conjectured and D.\\xa0Hofstadter in 1976 computationally supported that $\\\\Sigma_{\\\\lambda,\\\\alpha,\\\\omega}$ has the characteristic of being either band-like for rational $\\\\alpha$ or fractal-like for irrational $\\\\alpha$. Decades later A.\\xa0Avila and S.\\xa0Jitomirskaya in 2009 made the final contribution to the resolution of the Ten Martini Problem which sought to confirm the conjectured topological structure of $\\\\Sigma_{\\\\lambda,\\\\alpha,\\\\omega}$. If $\\\\alpha=\\\\frac{p}{q}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{T}\\\\cap\\\\mathbb{Q}$, then $\\\\Sigma_{\\\\lambda,\\\\alpha,\\\\omega}$ is a disjoint union of at most $q$-many compact intervals. If $\\\\alpha\\\\in \\\\mathbb{T}\\\\setminus\\\\mathbb{Q}$, then $\\\\Sigma_{\\\\lambda,\\\\alpha,\\\\omega}$ is a Cantor set. Also, $\\\\Sigma_{\\\\lambda,\\\\alpha,\\\\omega}$ is independent of the phase $\\\\omega$ when the frequency $\\\\alpha$ is irrational. This last fact can be found in the 1982 review paper by B.\\xa0Simon (where the name of the almost Mathieu operator was introduced) and applies to operators with quasiperiodic potentials; the definition of quasiperiodic potentials can be found within <span class=\"smallcaps\">subsection\\xa0<a href=\"#subsec: Quasiperiodic Potentials and The Almost Mathieu Operator\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"subsec: Quasiperiodic Potentials and The Almost Mathieu Operator\">2.3</a></span>. In general, phase independence of the spectrum for operators with quasiperiodic potentials follows from the fact that the underlying topological dynamical system $(\\\\mathbb{T}^b,\\\\mathbb{Z})$ is minimal .\\n\\nLet $d\\\\ge 2$ be a positive integer. We consider the $d$-dimensional analog operator $\\\\vphantom{H}\\\\smash{\\\\widehat{H}}$ generated by almost Mathieu operators. Specifically, $\\\\vphantom{H}\\\\smash{\\\\widehat{H}}$ is the discrete Schrödinger operator on $\\\\ell^2(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ defined by $$\\\\textstyle[\\\\vphantom{H}\\\\smash{\\\\widehat{H}}\\\\psi](n)=\\\\big(\\\\sum_{m\\\\in \\\\mleft\\\\{e_1,\\\\ldots,e_d\\\\mright\\\\}}\\\\psi(n+m)+\\\\psi(n-m)\\\\big)+\\\\big(\\\\sum_{k\\\\in\\\\mleft\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,d\\\\mright\\\\}}2\\\\lambda_k\\\\cos(2\\\\pi(n_k\\\\alpha_k+\\\\omega_k))\\\\big)\\\\psi(n)$$ for every $\\\\psi\\\\in\\\\ell^2(\\\\mathbb{Z}^d),n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}^d$; $\\\\mleft\\\\{e_1,\\\\ldots,e_d\\\\mright\\\\}$ is the standard basis. The operator $\\\\vphantom{H}\\\\smash{\\\\widehat{H}}$ and the spectrum $\\\\vphantom{\\\\Sigma}\\\\smash{\\\\widehat{\\\\Sigma}}=\\\\Sigma_{\\\\lambda_1,\\\\alpha_1,\\\\omega_1}+\\\\cdots+\\\\Sigma_{\\\\lambda_d,\\\\alpha_d,\\\\omega_d}$ are the main objects of study in this paper. The theory of the almost Mathieu operator provides insight into the theory of $\\\\vphantom{H}\\\\smash{\\\\widehat{H}}$. Consider the following theorem established by A.\\xa0Avila and D.\\xa0Damanik in 2008 : If $\\\\lambda\\\\ne 1$ and $\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathbb{T}\\\\setminus\\\\mathbb{Q}$, then the integrated density of states of the almost Mathieu operator is absolutely continuous. Along with a theorem by Steinhaus, which states that the sum of two sets with positive Lebesgue-measure contains an open interval, we immediately obtain the following proposition.\\n\\n<div id=\"prop: PROP\" class=\"prop\">\\n\\n**Proposition 1**. *Assume at least two among $\\\\lambda_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\lambda_d$ are not equal to $1$ and $\\\\alpha_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha_d\\\\in\\\\mathbb{T}\\\\setminus\\\\mathbb{Q}$. Then $\\\\vphantom{\\\\Sigma}\\\\smash{\\\\widehat{\\\\Sigma}}$ has a dense interior.*\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nMore can be obtained in the small coupling and Diophantine frequency regime. This is the context of the main theorem in this paper.',\n",

       "  'text': '*Anderson localization* (pure point spectrum with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions) for quasi-periodic operators has been widely studied over the past sixty years. We give a brief review here. As one can see, both the operators <a href=\"#1.2\" data-reference-type=\"eqref\" data-reference=\"1.2\">[1.2]</a> and <a href=\"#1.1\" data-reference-type=\"eqref\" data-reference=\"1.1\">[1.1]</a> are a family of operators parameterized by two parameters, $(\\\\alpha,\\\\theta)$ in <a href=\"#1.2\" data-reference-type=\"eqref\" data-reference=\"1.2\">[1.2]</a> and $(\\\\alpha,x)$ in <a href=\"#1.1\" data-reference-type=\"eqref\" data-reference=\"1.1\">[1.1]</a>, when $V$ is fixed. When $d=1$, Fröhlich-Spencer-Wittwer and Sinai proved that $H_{\\\\lambda V,\\\\alpha,x}$ has Anderson localization for $a.e.$ $x$ and large enough $\\\\lambda$ if $V$ is cosine-like and $\\\\alpha$ is Diophantine [^1]. Eliasson proved that if $V$ is a Gevrey function satisfying non-degenerate conditions, for any *fixed* Diophantine $\\\\alpha$, $H_{\\\\lambda V,\\\\alpha,x}$ has pure point spectrum for $a.e.$ $x$ and large enough $\\\\lambda$. Bourgain and Goldstein proved that, in the positive Lyapunov exponent regime, for any *fixed* $x$, $H_{\\\\lambda W,\\\\alpha,x}$ has AL for $a.e.$ Diophantine $\\\\alpha$ provided that $V$ is a non-constant real analytic function. Bourgain and Jitomirskaya generalized the result in to certain band models. Klein generalized the results in to more general Gevrey potentials.\\n\\nWe would like to remark that gave an arithmetic description on the localization frequency $\\\\alpha$, but they didn’t have an arithmetic description on the localization phase $\\\\theta$, in contrast, proved localization for fixed phase $\\\\theta$, but there is no arithmetic description on the localization frequency $\\\\alpha$. Thus, for any fixed $(\\\\alpha,x)$, it is not clear whether $H_{\\\\lambda W,\\\\alpha,x}$ has AL. The breakthrough belongs to Jitomirskaya who proved that for any *fixed* Diophantine frequency and *any fixed* Diophantine phase[^2], the almost Mathieu operator has AL if $|\\\\lambda|>1$. Recently, such arithmetic description on the frequency and the phase was explored even in a sharp way . Namely, for Diophantine phase, there is a sharp spectral transition in frequency . For Diophantine frequency, there is a sharp spectral transition in phase . For more general quasi-periodic long-range operators <a href=\"#1.2\" data-reference-type=\"eqref\" data-reference=\"1.2\">[1.2]</a>, Bourgain and Jitomirskaya generalized the methods in and proved that for any *fixed* Diophantine frequency and *fixed* Diophantine phase, $L_{\\\\lambda V,\\\\alpha,\\\\theta}$ has AL for small $\\\\lambda$ and real analytic $V$. For more such kinds of results, one may consult e.t.c. The localization results which have arithmetic descriptions on both the frequency and the phase, are called *arithmetic version of Anderson localization*.',\n",

In the process, we avoid the Schur complement computation that could involve resolvent calculations of large matrices. Additionally, the general setting we consider incan be further extended to higher-dimensional graphs and would allow us to define Jacobi-type operators on graphs like the Sierpinski lattices or Diamond graphs.

Moreover, it provides a natural finite graph approximation for the half-integer lattice.

This method paves the way for optimal arithmetic reducibility results for such cocycles, thereby resolving Jitomirskaya\\'s conjecture. From a spectral perspective, it leads to optimal arithmetic Anderson localization for a class of quasiperiodic long-range operators on higher-dimensional lattices. In particular, using structured quantitative almost reducibility, we establish a sharp quantitative version of Aubry duality, enabling us to uncover new spectral insights for almost Mathieu operators with Diophantine frequencies. For example, we precisely determine the exponential decay rate of spectral gaps in non-critical cases, thus addressing a question raised by Goldstein. Additionally, we reveal the optimal asymptotic growth of extended eigenfunctions for subcritical almost Mathieu operators.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThis paper focuses on the role of resonances in quasiperiodic dynamical systems. A defining characteristic of quasiperiodic dynamics is the profound impact of arithmetic on its behavior, famously manifesting as the \"small denominators\" problem in various models, such as circle diffeomorphisms, disc dynamics, quasiperiodic cocycles, surface flows, and Hamiltonian systems in finite and infinite dimensions. The primary challenge in managing \"small denominators\" issues lies in dealing with various types of resonances.\\n\\nIn this paper, we focus on a significant class of quasiperiodic dynamical systems, named analytic quasiperiodic  cocycles.

Eliasson proved that if  is a Gevrey function satisfying non-degenerate conditions, for any fixed Diophantine ,  has pure point spectrum for   and large enough .   Bourgain and Goldstein proved that, in the positive Lyapunov exponent regime, for any fixed ,  has AL for    Diophantine  provided that   is a non-constant real analytic function. Bourgain and Jitomirskaya generalized the result in to certain band models. Klein generalized the results in to more general Gevrey potentials.\\n\\nWe would like to remark that gave an arithmetic description on the localization frequency , but they didn't have an arithmetic description on the localization phase , in contrast, proved localization  for fixed phase , but there is no arithmetic description on the localization frequency .

The breakthrough belongs to Jitomirskaya who proved  that for any fixed Diophantine frequency and any  fixed Diophantine phase(  is  called Diophantine, denoted by , if there exist  and  such that\\n)\\nLet ., the almost Mathieu operator has AL if . Recently, such arithmetic description on the frequency and the phase was explored even in a sharp way. Namely, for Diophantine phase, there is a sharp spectral transition in frequency. For Diophantine frequency, there is a sharp spectral transition in phase.\\n\\nFor more general quasi-periodic long-range operators 1.2, Bourgain and Jitomirskaya generalized the methods in and proved that for any fixed Diophantine frequency and fixed Diophantine phase,  has AL for small  and real analytic .

The unitary update rule of this quantum walk shares many spectral characteristics with the critical Almost-Mathieu Operator; however, it possesses a feature not present in the Almost-Mathieu Operator, namely singularity of the associated cocycles (this feature is, however, present in the so-called Extended Harper's Model). We show that this operator has empty absolutely continuous spectrum and that the Lyapunov exponent vanishes on the spectrum; hence, this model exhibits Cantor spectrum of zero Lebesgue measure for all irrational frequencies and arbitrary phase, which in physics is known as Hofstadter's butterfly. In fact, we will show something stronger, namely, that all spectral parameters in the spectrum are of critical type, in the language of Avila's global theory of analytic quasiperiodic cocycles. We further prove that it has empty point spectrum for each irrational frequency and away from a frequency-dependent set of phases having Lebesgue measure zero. The key ingredients in our proofs are an adaptation of Avila's Global Theory to the present setting, self-duality via the Fourier transform, and a Johnson-type theorem for singular dynamically defined CMV matrices which characterizes their spectra as the set of spectral parameters at which the associated cocycles fail to admit a dominated splitting.\n\nIntroduction",

In the case of one-dimensional coined quantum walks, a substantial amount of progress has been made by using the beautiful observation of Cantero, Grunbaum, Moral, and Velazquez which relates the unitary time-one maps of such quantum walks with CMV matrices, a class of unitary operators which arise from a separate construction in the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle (OPUC). In particular, this connection enables one to translate questions about the dynamics of a quantum walk into questions about the spectral theory of CMV matrices and OPUC, a subject for which an enormous number of powerful tools exist; see, e.g.,.\n\nIn the present paper, we will study a particular one-dimensional coined quantum walk with quasi-periodically distributed coins.

We will show that these operators share many spectral characteristics with the critical AMO, such as purely singular continuous spectrum supported on a Cantor set of zero Lebesgue measure.

In Section , we use global theory for singular one-frequency quasiperiodic cocycles to prove that the Lyapunov exponent vanishes on the spectrum. When combined with Kotani theory and the singular nature of the spectrum, this yields the conclusion of Theorem ., namely, that the spectrum is a Cantor set of zero Lebesgue measure. In Section , we work out an essential ingredient in our application of global theory, namely, a version of the theorem of Johnson for singular CMV matrices which identifies the resolvent set with the set of spectral parameters at which the associated matrix cocycles enjoy a dominated splitting.  To the best of our knowledge, this is only known for nonsingular CMV matrices, i.e., CMV matrices whose Verblunsky coefficients are bounded away from the unit circle. We prove Johnson's theorem in the singular case by adapting the techniques in Marx which were developed for singular Jacobi matrices. We expect that this result is of independent interest beyond quasiperiodic quantum walks, and so we formulate it in an appropriately general context.\n\nAcknowledgements",

The first version expresses a classical version of duality between eigenfunctions and Bloch waves, while the second is a slightly more abstract framework which shows how (direct integrals of) the coin and shift operators are dual to one another via the Fourier transform. For the spectral analysis in the present paper, we only need the first version of duality. However, we explicitly work out the second version for two reasons. First, this second version is clearly a natural analogue of the usual Aubry duality transform, which has been extremely useful in the spectral analysis of the self-adjoint AMO as shown in. Secondly, this version reflects how some authors think about duality in the physics literature. Concretely, this version of duality puts the heuristic discussion in on a firm mathematical foundation.\n\nTo describe the first version of duality, let us define the inverse Fourier transform of a sequence  by\n\nAdditionally, for , we denote its Fourier transform by\n\nGiven , let us use eq:typicalelt to view it as a pair of  sequences  and .

We will rely on in this section. In particular, we shall use several theorems in that are asserted in that paper for  and for nonnegative real , but are in fact true for  and for complex  (see formula eq:iSU2 for where  appears). Here  is the spectrum of the CMV matrix. It is straightforward to verify that the theorems that we need and quote apply directly to the more general setting.\n\nDominated splitting and non-degenerate Lyapunov spectrumWe first introduce the idea of a dominated splitting, which is a notion from smooth ergodic theory that generalizes uniform hyperbolicity. Let  be a compact metric space,  be a homeomorphism, and  be any -ergodic probability measure on .\n\nRecall that  refers to the set of  complex matrices. By dynamics:cocycle, for each measurable  there corresponds a dynamical system defined by\n\nWe denote the iterates of this cocycle by . By iteration:cocycle,  for integers , and  is the identity matrix.\n\nWe further assume . Then, we say  admits a dominated splitting (we write ) if there exists a continuous decomposition  for all  with  satisfying the following two properties:\n\nFor all , .\n\nThere exists a  such that uniformly for all  and for all unit vectors , it holds that\n\nEquivalently, it is not difficult to see that a cocycle  admits a dominated splitting if and only if there exists  and a continuous change of coordinates  such that\n\nwhere  satisfy\n\nMuch like uniform hyperbolicity,  is an open condition in the space  which may be detected by an invariant cone criterion.",

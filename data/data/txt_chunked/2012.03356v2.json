That is why the approach described  by\nWilkinson is called a renormalization method. Using methods of the\npseudodifferential operator theory, B. Helffer and J.\nSjostrand have developed a rigorous asymptotic renormalization method,\nand  turned the heuristic  results into mathematical theorems.\n\nLet us note that the asymptotic renormalization methods are used when\nthe parameter  can be represented as a continued fraction with\nsufficiently large elements.\n\nLater,  V. Buslaev and A. Fedotov suggested  the monodromization\nmethod, one more renormalization approach that arose when trying to use\nthe Bloch-Floquet theory ideas to study the geometry of the spectrum of\ndifference operators  in . The method was further\ndeveloped by A.Fedotov and F.Klopp when studying adiabatic quasiperiodic\noperators. More details can be found in review . The\nmonodromization method can be used for one-dimensional two-frequency\ndifference and differential quasiperiodic operators independently  of any\nassumptions on  the continued fraction. If such an equation contains an\nasymptotic parameter, one can effectively describe the asymptotic geometry\nof the spectrum.\nIn  we described how to apply the monodromization method to\nget a constructive asymptotic description of the spectrum  as a Cantor set\nin the case studied by B. Helffer and J. Sjostrand. The present paper is\nthe first step to a similar constructive asymptotic description in the\ncase of a small coupling constant. Here, we make only the first\nrenormalization. This allows to describe asymptotically a series of the\nlongest spectral gaps. We get asymptotic formulas for the gap centers and\nlower bounds for the gap lengths. Note that,  the number of the\ngaps we describe can be of the order of , and the length\nof the -th gap is roughly  of the order of . So, it can be\ndifficult to get such results by means of standard perturbation methods.\n\nThe results we prove in this paper were partially announced in the short\nnote .",

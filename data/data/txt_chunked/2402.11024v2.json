For instance, it is clear that an estimate of the form eq:rhosymm is needed to obtain useful estimates on the quantities in, for example, eq:longWronskiCalc and lem:25:Phiipm0setup. Thus, in addition to the identity eq:alphasymm for the 's, one also must have a symmetry of the type eq:rhosymm for the 's, and such a symmetry cannot hold for standard CMV matrices, so one absolutely must complexify to reveal the necessary symmetry.\nIn fact, as the reader will see, even with the new ideas using gauge transforms to relate to the complexified  case, the computations are somewhat more laborious in the present setting. For instance, one may compare the proof of Lemma  to the corresponding computation in.

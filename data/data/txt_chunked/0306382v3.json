We point the reader to for a discussion of\nthis and further generalizations.\n\nBoth theorems above are valid in a much more general setting, namely for\ncocycles over transformations preserving a probability measure.  The\nrequirement on the cocycle is the least  to speak of Lyapunov exponents\n(and Oseledets theory), namely integrability of the logarithm of the norm.\n\nFibered rotation number\nBesides the Lyapunov exponent, there is one important invariant\nassociated to continuous cocycles which are\nhomotopic to the identity.  This invariant, called the fibered rotation\nnumber will be denoted by , and\nwas introduced in, (we recall its definition in\nAppendix A).\nThe fibered rotation number is a continuous function of\n, where  varies in the space of continuous cocycles\nwhich are homotopic to the identity.  Another important elementary\nfact is that both  and  have nondecreasing lifts , and in\nparticular, those functions have nonnegative derivatives almost everywhere.\nThe following result was proved in, in the continuous time case,\nand in, in the discrete time case used here\n(and where an optimal estimate is given).\n\nLet .  Then for almost every  such that\n,\n\nThis result (and proof) also generalize to the setting of Theorem A (see\nfor further generalizations):\n\nLet  be continuous and homotopic to the\nidentity.  Then for almost every  such that\n,\n\nIn the Schrodinger case, it is possible to show that the fibered rotation\nnumber is a surjective function (of ) onto .

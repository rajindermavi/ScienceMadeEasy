At the same time,  various physically desirable conclusions, such as e.g. the\nexponential decay of the two-point function at the ground state and\npositive temperatures with correlation length staying uniformly\nbounded as temperature goes to zero, are often\nimplicitly assumed as attributes of localization. A way\nto derive them currently requires a strong form of dynamical\nlocalization: the exponential (in space) rate of decay of\nthe two point function,\nthat is\n\nwhere\nis a complete set of orthonormalized eigenfunctions (and the sum may\nbe localized in energy, if needed).\n\nIn view of this, the exponential decay rate in expectation was\ndefined  in as",

This\ndefinition can be localized  to an energy range by summing over the\neigenfunctions with energies falling in the range, in which case it is\nlinked to the minimal inverse correlation length for Fermi energies\nfalling in that range.\n\nIt is well known that there is a long road from positive Lyapunov exponents\nto a statement like (). First, positive Lyapunov exponents\ndon't even imply pure point spectrum for a.e. phase. Even\nfor models with positive Lyapunov exponents and known pure point spectrum, dynamical localization\nmay not hold, and then an averaged statement (dubbed\nstrong dynamical localization) is\nstrictly stronger, and a result such as\nedl is stronger yet (albeit equivalent in all known\nexamples so far).\n\nYet it may be natural to expect that there is a certain reason to\nphysicists' jump in conclusions, and that for physically relevant\nmodels Lyapunov exponent is indeed related to .\n\nIn this paper we prove the first such result. It turns out that for\nalmost Mathieu operators,  that is operators on  given by\n() with potential (), arguably the most popular 1D model in\nphysics, the Lyapunov exponent precisely defines the dynamical decay\nrate.\n\nSuppose .

It is well known that the latter task is usually\nharder. In this paper we achieve this, at the same time making both\nestimates sharp. Our analysis uses (a small part of the) delicate\nestimates on eigenfunctions obtained in\n. The statements we need that are\nsimilar to those in are\npresented in the appendix, while the body of the paper consists of the\nnew argument needed to derive the sharp upper and lower bounds.\n\nIt is tempting to conjecture that Theorem  has a\nuniversal nature, but one should be cautious. For example, we do not\nexpect it to hold even for weakly Liouville almost Mathieu operators\nfor which localization has been established in, with\neigenfunctions decaying exponentially but at a non-Lyapunov\nrate. However, even for those a\nstatement of the form  may be plausible. Moreover,\nalmost Mathieu operators are special in that their Lyapunov exponent\nis constant on the spectrum, and without this condition the statement\nof the theorem doesn't even make sense. Yet, it is natural to expect that in many\nphysically relevant situations there should be a link between\nand , where  ()\nover  in the spectrum. For example, it is an interesting question\nto establish such a connection for the Anderson model where eigenfunctions\ndo decay at the Lyapunov rate (e.g.).

Our definition is based on a class of self-similar Laplacians instead of the standard discrete Laplacian, and  includes the classical almost Mathieu operators as a particular case. Our main result establishes that the spectra of these  self-similar almost Mathieu operators can be described by the spectra of the corresponding  self-similar Laplacians through the spectral decimation framework used in the context of spectral analysis on fractals. The spectral type of the self-similar Laplacians used in our model are singularly continuous. The self-similar almost Mathieu operators also have singularly continuous spectrum for specific parameters. In addition, we derive an explicit formula of the integrated density of states of the self-similar almost Mathieu operators as the weighted pre-images of the balanced invariant measure on a specific Julia set.\n\nIntroduction\nThe investigation of the properties of quasi-periodic Schrodinger-type operators remains very active drawing techniques from different areas of mathematics and physics.\nThe special case of the almost Mathieu operators (AMO)  can be traced back to Harper who proposed a model to describe crystal electrons in a uniform magnetic field.

Subsequently, Hofstadter observed that the spectra of the AMO can be fractal sets. We refer to for more early examples of such operators whose spectra are Cantor-like sets, and to\nfor more results on the AMO and references therein.\n\nIndependently,  a line of investigations of self-similar Laplacian operators on graphs, fractals, and networks has emerged. A fundamental tool in this framework is the spectral decimation method, initially  used in physics to compute the spectrum of the Laplacian on a Sierpinski lattice. At the heart of this method is the fact that  the spectrum of this Laplacian  is completely described in terms of iterations of a rational function. For an overview of the modern mathematical approaches, applications, and extensions of the spectral decimation methods we refer to  and references therein.\n\nRecently, Chen and Teplyaev used the general framework of the spectral decimation method to investigate the appearnce of the singular continuous spectrum of a family of Laplacian operators. One of the   ideas used in establishing this result is that these Laplacians are naturally related to self-similar operators  with corresponding self-similar structures which allows to use complex dynamics techniques.\n\nThe present paper is a first in what we expect to be a research program dealing with quasi-periodic Schrodinger-type operators  on self-similar sets such as fractals and graphs.  Our goal is to initiate the study of  a generalization of the discrete almost Mathieu operators for self-similar situations.\nIn this paper we begin by considering  finite or half-integer one-dimensional lattices endowed with   particular self-similar structures.\nMore general Jacobi matrices  will be considered in the forthcoming work .",

We refer to this class of operators as piecewise centrosymmetric Jacobi operators .\nIn this general setting we show that the spectral decimation function arises from a  particular system of orthogonal polynomials associated with the aforementioned Jacobi matrix. In particular, this spectral decimation function is computable using a three-term recursion formula associated to this system of orthogonal polynomials. In the process, we avoid the Schur complement computation that could involve resolvent calculations of large matrices. Additionally, the general setting we consider incan be further extended to higher-dimensional graphs and would allow us to define Jacobi-type operators on graphs like the Sierpinski lattices or Diamond graphs. We plan to use this approach to investigate some of the questions in.\n\nSelf-similar Laplacians and almost Mathieu operators In this section we introduce the notations and the definition of the self-similar structure we impose on the half-integer lattice.

We prove that it can be applied to  the sequence of almost Mathieu operators  for , ,  and . The method was intensively applied in the context of  Laplacians on fractals and self-similar graphs. Its central idea is that the spectrum of such Laplacian can be completely described in terms of iterations of a rational function,  called the spectral decimation function. Below, we extend this method to the self-similar almost Mathieu operators when the frequency  is appropriately calibrated with the hierarchical structure of the self-similar Laplacian. In this case, we provide a complete description of the spectrum of th-level almost Mathieu operators  by relating it to the spectrum of th-level Laplacian, i.e. .

In particular, this   direct approach   for gap labeling is complementing. In our case we do not make use of the   dual of a group acting on the fractal lattice, and observe that gap labels of the form  are consistent  with the self-similar quasi-periodic structure where renormalization acts by the dilation of the space  by . This should be contrasted with the gap labeling for fractal structures with more complicated topological structure currently under investigation in, including the classical Sierpinski gasket and a new model of the bubble diamond fractals. In general, on a certain class of self-similar structures the gaps  are labeled by the values of the\nintegrated density of states of the Laplacian with values  where  is the topological degree of the self-covering map of the fractal limit space.\nThus, our work  sets the stage for considering the Bloch theorem, noncommutative Chern characters and fractal-based quantum Hall systems, see  , as well as.

The result is a consequence\nof a criterion for the spectrum to contain an\ninterval at a given location that we establish non-perturbatively in\nthe regime of positive Lyapunov exponent.\n\nIntroductionIn the last 40 years after the groundbreaking paper  the theory of quasiperiodic Schrodinger operators has been developed\nextensively, see the monograph for an overview and\nfor a survey of the more recent results.  For shifts\non a one-dimensional torus  most of the results have been\nestablished non-perturbatively, i.e., either in the regime of almost\nreducibility or in the regime of positive Lyapunov exponent, and\nAvila's global theory, see, gives a qualitative spectral\npicture, covering both regimes, for generic potentials. One of the\nmain results of the one-dimensional theory is the fact that the\nspectrum is a Cantor set. For the case of the almost Mathieu operator\n(corresponding to a cosine potential), this result has been proved for\nany non-zero coupling and any irrational shift, see\nand. For general analytic\npotentials in the regime of positive Lyapunov\nexponent with generic shift the Cantor structure of the spectrum has\nbeen obtained in.\n\nOn the other\nhand, shifts on a multidimensional torus  turned out to be\nharder to analyze and the theory is less developed, even in the\nperturbative setting.\nIn particular, not much is known about the geometry of the spectrum\nfor multidimensional shifts.  In their pioneering paper\n, Chulaevsky and Sinai conjectured that in contrast to\nthe shift on the one-dimensional torus, for the two-dimensional shift\nthe spectrum can be an interval for generic large smooth\npotentials. In this paper we prove this conjecture for large analytic potentials.",

In this paper we prove this conjecture for large analytic potentials.\n\nHeuristically, gaps in the spectrum of the one-frequency\noperators are created by horizontal \"forbidden\nzones\" appearing at the points of  intersection of the graphs of shifted finite\nscale eigenvalues parametrized by phase,\nsee . In contrast to this, the heuristic\nprinciple underlying is that for multiple frequencies, the intersection curves\nof the  graphs of shifted finite scale\neigenvalues may not be too flat, thus preventing the appearance of the  horizontal  \"forbidden\nzones\" and stopping the formation of gaps.  It is clear that some genericity\nassumption on the potential function is needed for this to be true,\nsince potentials like  lead to flat intersection curves\nand have Cantor spectrum. Furthermore, the largeness of the potential\nis also needed. Indeed, it is known that for small potentials with\natypical frequency vector the spectrum has gaps, see.\n\nImplementing such an argument, appears to be very challenging for a\nnumber of reasons. First, the analytical techniques available in\nfinite volume are less favorable (mainly the large deviation theorems\nand everything that depends on them) as compared to the\ncase of one frequency. In particular, it is difficult to implement an\napproach based on finite scale localization as in\n. This is due to the fact that it is hard to handle\nlong chains of resonances and to control the intersections of the resonant\ncurves with the level sets of the eigenvalues.

However, for the purpose of this paper one would\nneed a refined version of finite scale localization, beyond what is achieved in that paper.\nWe analyze the spectrum of the operator , , on a finite interval  subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions.\nTo keep this spectrum under control requires resolving the following problem.\nGiven  let  be the set of all phases  such that  is in the spectrum of the\noperator . One has to identify phases  for which  is not too close to\nas  runs in the interval , . This issue, commonly referred to as double resonances,  is well-known.\nSimilar strategies, leading to the formation of intervals in the\nspectrum, have been implemented for the skew-shift\nin  and for continuous two-dimensional Schrodinger\noperators in .\nThe main new device that we develop in this work,  consists of an elimination of double resonances for all\nshifts , and not just the \"arithmetic ones\" . Of course the shift  cannot be too small.\nAlthough this problem looks  less accessible, it  turns out to provide more control on the  resonant set  of the previous scale.\nThe level sets  of the potential in question must satisfy the requirements of this more general elimination in order to launch the multi-scale analysis.\nThis is exactly the origin of our main condition on the potential, see Definition  below.\n\nFurthermore, in order to show that the spectrum is actually an\ninterval,  we develop a Cartan type estimate that\ncontrols the intersections of the level sets of an analytic function\nnear a non-degenerate extremum with their shifts.",

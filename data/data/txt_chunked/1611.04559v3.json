This fact motivates us to the question whether for any irrational  the spectrum of  has the same property, i.e. whether it is purely singularly continuous for Lebesgue a.e. .\n\nA deeper question concerns the physical meaning of the model that involves a magnetic field changing linearly along the chain. A philosophical answer could be, according the known quip of Bratelli and Robinson, that \"validity of such idealizations is the heart and soul of theoretical physics and has the same fundamental significance as the reproducibility of experimental data\". On a more mundane level, one can note that the spectral behaviour will not change if the linear field is replaced by a quasiperiodic one which changes in a saw-tooth-like fashion as long as the jumps coincide with the graph vertices. This also opens an interesting question about the spectral form and type in case when the saw-tooth shape is replaced by another periodic or quasiperiodic function.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are obliged to Konstantin Pankrashkin for his constructive\ncriticism which helped to improve the manuscript.

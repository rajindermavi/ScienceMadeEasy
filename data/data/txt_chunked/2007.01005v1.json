Krasovsky\n\nWe derive a new Chambers-type formula and prove sharper upper bounds on the\nmeasure of the spectrum of critical almost Mathieu operators with\nrational frequencies.\n\nIntroduction\nThe Harper operator, a.k.a. the discrete magnetic Laplacian(The\nname \"discrete magnetic Laplacian\" was first introduced by M. Shubin in.), is\na tight-binding model of an electron confined\nto a 2D square lattice in a\nuniform magnetic field orthogonal to the lattice plane and with flux  through an elementary cell.\nIt acts on\nand\nis usually given in the Landau gauge representation\n\nfirst considered by Peierls, who noticed that it makes the Hamiltonian separable and\nturns it into the direct integral in  of operators\non  given by:\n\nIn physics literature, it also appears under the names Harper's or  the Azbel-Hofstadter\nmodel, with both names  used also for the discrete magnetic\nLaplacian .  In mathematics, it is universally called the critical almost Mathieu\noperator.(This name was originally introduced by Barry Simon\n.) In addition to importance in physics, this model is of\nspecial interest, being at the boundary of two reasonably well\nunderstood regimes: (almost) localization and (almost) reducibility,\nand not being amenable to methods of either side. Recently, there has been some\nprogress in the study of the fine structure of its spectrum.\n\nDenote the spectrum of an operator  as a set, by . An important object is the union of   over\nwhich coincides with the spectrum of . We denote it .\nNote that by the general theory of ergodic operators, if  is irrational,\nis independent of . We denote the Lebesgue measure of a set  by .",

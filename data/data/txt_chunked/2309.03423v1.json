The latter condition is the  reason that semi-algebraic sets enter into the analysis in a crucial and quantitative fashion.\nWe will rely on *Chapter 9 for the technical statements about semi-algebraic theory, in particular on Corollary 9.7 and Lemma 9.9 in loc. cit. However, we would like to point out that the  Yomdin parametrization of Theorem 9.4 with quantitative polynomial bounds, which is needed in these results, was erroneously attributed to Gromov's work during the mid 1980s. In fact, these essential polynomial bounds were finally established by Binyamini and Novikov , thus closing a gap in  that had remained open for almost 15 years.\n\nTo begin the localization proof, we start from a solution  with  and  for all . The latter is the folklore Shnol's theorem, see e.g. *Theorem 2.1 for a self-contained derivation.   Arguing as in *(10.7), (10.8) we see that we may cover the set  by a semi-algebraic set  of polynomial degree  in all the variables , and  of similar measure. In this step, one uses that the Diophantine condition  is only needed in the range  for Lemma  to hold (see *page 859).\nWe denote this finite volume Diophantine condition by .\n\nIt follows from *Corollary 9.7, (10.12), (10.13) that for any large  there exists  so that with\n\nwhere  and  is some large constant depending on  through the Diophantine parameter .

As a starting point, we   focus on a particular case, namely, completely resonant phases for the almost Mathieu operator,\nin which   phase resonances and frequency resonances    overlap. As we were finalizing this paper we learned of a preprint  where the study of the numerators also plays an important  role, but in a completely different setting of unbounded potentials and  the so-called anti-resonances.\n\nWe say a  phase  is completely resonant with respect to a  frequency  if . One of the motivations   to study  completely resonant phases   is their critical roles in the spectral theory of quasiperiodic Schrodinger operators, for instance, spectral gap edges  . Another motivation comes from a conjecture of\nAvila and Jitomirskaya in     and Jitomirskaya  .\n\nConjecture 1: Avila and Jitomirskaya    conjectured   that the almost Mathieu operator   satisfies Anderson localization  if   and  ,\nwhere\n\nand  .\n\nConjecture 1  is also  a particular case of a conjecture  of Jitomirskaya   .\nIn this paper, we prove Conjecture 1 as it is.\nAssume that     satisfies .

However, such an argument  does not work  for resonant sites  (only coming from phase resonances) since the  repetition of potentials only appears at sites  by the   continued fraction expansion approximation. We regard  norms of generalized eigenfunctions at resonant sites   and numerators of  Green's functions around  resonant sites  as variables.\nOur first step is to establish inequalities among those variables.  By solving those inequalities, we obtain the relations among resonant sites. Then the exponential  decay at the resonant sites follows from  standard iterations.\n\nFinally, we want to highlight another technical   novelty in our proof. The Gordon type argument works along with the transfer matrices,  which slightly differs from the denominators  and numerators of  Green's functions.\nWe introduce  the  notation\nto represent the denominator of  the Green's function restricting  to the interval .

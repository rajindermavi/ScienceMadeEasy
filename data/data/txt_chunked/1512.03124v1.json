We will find  the exact transition point from singular\ncontinuous spectrum to purely point spectrum of Almost Mathieu operator, thus solve  Jitomirskaya's conjecture in 1995(see also Problem 8 in).\nMore precisely, let  be the th convergent of  and\ndefine\nour main results are the following:\n\nLet  with , then\nwe have the following:\n\nIf  then  has\npurely absolutely continuous spectrum for all .\nIf  then  has\npurely singular continuous spectrum for all .\nIf  then  has\npurely point spectrum with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions\nfor a.e. .\n\nPart (1) is proved by Avila, we state here just for\ncompleteness. The cases  have been solved in previous works. Together with Theorem ,\none sees the sharp phase transition scenario of three types of the spectral measure. Moreover, the type of the spectral measure\nis clear for all  except the line . See Figure 1 and Figure 2 below.\n\nTheorem (3), also called Anderson localization (AL),  is optimal in the sense\nthat the result can not be true for  dense  . The\narithmetic property of  will influence the spectral measure.\n\nNow we\nbriefly recall the history of this problem. By symmetry, we just need to consider the case . In 1980, Aubry-Andre\nconjectured that the spectral measure of\ndepends on  in the following\nway:\n\nIf  then  has\npurely absolutely continuous spectrum for all , and  all .\nIf  then  has\npure point spectrum for all , and  all\n.",

However, in they can only prove the eigenvalues of  with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions are dense in the spectrum. The main issue remained is to prove  those eigenfunctions form a complete basis. The key point in this paper is that, we find  that the quantitative estimates in the proof of Theorem  actually provides\nan asymptotical\ndistribution of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, which ultimately implies  pure point spectrum for almost every phases.\nCompared with tradition localization argument, the price we have to pay is that we lose precise arithmetic  control on  the localization phases.\nHowever, by this approach, one can indeed  establish a kind of  equivalence\nbetween quantitative full measure reducibility of Schrodinger\noperator (or Schrodinger cocycle) and Anderson\nlocalization of its dual Long-range operator.\n\nProof Theorem :   We\nneed the following definition:\n\nFor any fixed , a normalized eigenfunction\nis said to be  -good, if , for .\n\nWe label the -good eigenfunctions of  by ,  denote the corresponding\neigenvalue by , also we  denote\n\nand denote\nLet  be the spectral measure supported on\nwith respect to .\n\nThe following spectral analysis is completely new and  will be crucial for our proof.\nSuppose that there exists , such that for any  there\nexists , and for a.e. ,\nfor  large enough, then for a.e.\n, we have  .\n\nFix  such that () is satisfied.

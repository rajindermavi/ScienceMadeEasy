The separable operator considered in Theorem but with added background potential (so the resulting operator is not necessarily separable) has been studied by J. Bourgain and I. Kachkovskiy. Similar but distinct quasiperiodic (not necessarily separable) operators have been studied by S. Jitomirskaya, W. Liu, and Y. Shi. The results pertain to the spectral type but not the topological structure of the spectrum as a set. In section we state the preliminaries. In section we prove the main theorem. In section we prove a lemma used in the proof of the main theorem. Preliminaries Let be a bounded operator. The spectrum of is denoted . Note is a nonempty compact subset of .

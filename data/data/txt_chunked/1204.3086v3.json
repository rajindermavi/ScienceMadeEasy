The underlying dynamics is either the skew-shift or the multi-frequency shift by a Diophantine frequency.  We assume that the potential function belongs to a Gevrey class on the multi-dimensional torus. Moreover, we assume that the potential function satisfies a generic transversality condition, which we show to imply a Lojasiewicz type inequality for smooth functions of several variables.  Under these assumptions and for large coupling constant, we prove that the associated Lyapunov exponent is positive for all energies, and continuous as a function of energy, with a certain modulus of continuity.\nMoreover, in the large coupling constant regime and for an asymptotically large frequency - phase set, we prove that the operator satisfies Anderson localization.\n\nDefinitions, notations, statement of main results\nIn this paper we study the one-dimensional lattice quasiperiodic Schrodinger operator  acting on   by:\n\nwhere in equation ():\n\nis a parameter that introduces some randomness into the system;\n\nis a real number called the disorder of the system;\n\nis a real valued function on , that is, a real valued\n-periodic function in each variable;\n\nis a specific ergodic transformation on , and  is its th iteration.",

In other words, for the skew-shift, these results are expected to be independent of the size of the disorder . Hence one expects that if , the Lyapunov exponent is positive and Anderson localization holds for all energies. Moreover, one expects no gaps in the spectrum (unlike in the one-frequency shift case, when the spectrum is a Cantor set) - see the comments at the end of Chapter 15 in. Some results on these very challenging problems have been obtained in\n,,,.\n\nLocalization results for these types of operators defined by skew-shift dynamics have applications to quantum chaos problems. More specifically, they imply existence of almost periodic solutions to the quantum kicked rotator equation. However, one has to establish (dynamical) localization for a more general, long range operator, one where the discrete Laplacian is replaced by a Toeplitz operator with fast off-diagonal decay of its monodromy matrix entries.

These averages are shown to converge in a quantitative way to the mean of the function. The result holds for both the skew-shift and the multi-frequency shift.\n\nFor the skew-shift, the result was proven in (see Lemma 2.6 there). We will reproduce here the scaled version of that result, the one that takes into account the size of the domain of subharmonicity and the sup norm of the function. The reader can verify, by following the details of the proof in, that this is indeed the correct scaled version.\nFor the multi-frequency shift, the result is essentially contained within the proof of Theorem 5.5 in, but for completeness, we will include here the details of its proof.\n\nLet  be a real valued function on , that extends to a pluri-subharmonic function  on a strip .

Given the ergodicity of the transformation  for irrational (or rationally independent) frequencies, on the long run, the orbits   of most points  will tend to be fairly well distributed throughout the torus  (see the picture below).\n\nThe average  will then resemble a Riemann sum of the function  and as such, it will approach the integral .",

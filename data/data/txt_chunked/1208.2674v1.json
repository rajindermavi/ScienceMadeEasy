Various dynamical localization formulations have been\nsuggested and proved, by different methods, for most popular models,\nparticularly, for the Anderson model. Aside\nfrom uniform dynamical localization that happens rarely for ergodic families\n, the strongest dynamical localization property is\nthe exponential (in space) rate of decay of the expected overlap,\nthat is\n_t _k^- t H _\nC ^-k -\nA stronger, but equivalent in all known examples, formulation is\n() with  replaced with an arbitrary bounded\nfunction  or, equivalently, by the exponential decay of\nwhere\nis a complete set of orthonormalized eigenfunctions (and the sum may\nbe localized in energy, if needed). As pointed out in, this\nleads to various interesting physical conclusions, for example the\nexponential decay of the two-point function at the ground state and\npositive temperatures with correlation length staying uniformly\nbounded as temperature goes to zero. Moreover, it is this conclusion\nthat is often implicitly assumed as manifesting localization, in\nphysics literature. It is therefore desirable to establish it for\nphysically relevant models.\n\nIt is natural in this context to define the exponential decay rate in expectation (obviously\nconnected to the minimal inverse correlation length) as",

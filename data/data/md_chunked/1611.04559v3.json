This follows from the fact that $L_{\\boldsymbol{A}}$ is unitarily equivalent to $L_{\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}}$ whenever $\\left|a_j\\right| = \\left|\\tilde a_j\\right|$. It can be easily checked that the equivalence is mediated by the unitary operator $U_{\\boldsymbol{A},\n\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}}$, i.e. $L_{\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}} = U_{\\boldsymbol{A}, \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}} L_{\\boldsymbol{A}} U_{\\boldsymbol{A}, \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}}^{-1}$, defined by $$\\big(U_{\\boldsymbol{A}, \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}}\\varphi \\big)_j = u_j \\varphi_j,$$ for any $\\varphi \\in \\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z})$, where $$u_j =\n    \\cases{1& for $j = 0$,\\\\\n        s_j s_{j-1} \\ldots s_2 s_{1}& for $j > 0$,\\\\\n        s_j s_{j+1} \\ldots s_{-2} s_{-1}& for $j < 0$,}\n    \\quad\\mathrm{and} \\quad\n    s_j =\n    \\cases{1 & for $\\tilde a_j = a_j$,\\\\\n        -1 & otherwise.}$$ This unitary invariance can be used to find upper and lower bounds of the spectrum. By simple manipulations we get $$\\left\\langle\\varphi,L_{\\boldsymbol{A}} \\varphi\\right\\rangle = - \\sum_{j \\in \\mathbb{Z}} a_j \\left|\\varphi_{j+1} - \\varphi_j\\right|^2\n    + \\sum_{j \\in \\mathbb{Z}} (a_{j-1} + a_j) \\left|\\varphi_j\\right|^2.$$ Let $\\boldsymbol{A}^+$ be such that $a_j^+ = \\left|a_j\\right|$, then we have $$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\left\\langle\\varphi,L_{\\boldsymbol{A}} \\varphi\\right\\rangle\n    &= \\left\\langle U_{\\boldsymbol{A}, \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}}\\varphi,L_{\\boldsymbol{A}^+} U_{\\boldsymbol{A}, \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}}\\varphi\\right\\rangle\n    \\leq \\sum_{j \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\big(\\left|a_{j-1}\\right| + \\left|a_j\\right|\\big) \\left|\\big(U_{\\boldsymbol{A}, \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}}\\varphi \\big)_j\\right|^2\\\\\n    &\\leq \\sup_{j\\in\\mathbb{Z}} c_j \\left\\|\\varphi\\right\\|,\n\\end{aligned}$$ where $$c_j = \\left|a_{j-1}\\right| + \\left|a_j\\right| = 2\\big(\\left|\\cos(A_{j-1} \\pi)\\right| + \\left|\\cos(A_{j}\\pi)\\right|\\big).$$ Similarly, using $\\boldsymbol{A}^-$ such that $a_j^- = -\\left|a_j\\right|$, we get $$\\left\\langle\\varphi,L_{\\boldsymbol{A}} \\varphi\\right\\rangle\n    = \\left\\langle U_{\\boldsymbol{A}, \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}}\\varphi,L_{\\boldsymbol{A}^-} U_{\\boldsymbol{A}, \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}}\\varphi\\right\\rangle\n    \\geq -\\sup_{j\\in\\mathbb{Z}} c_j \\left\\|\\varphi\\right\\|,$$ which implies for the spectrum $$\\label{eq:spec_LA_bound}\n    \\sigma(L_{\\boldsymbol{A}}) \\subset [-\\sup_{j\\in\\mathbb{Z}}c_j, \\sup_{j\\in\\mathbb{Z}}c_j].$$\n\n<div class=\"remark\">\n\n*Remark 4*.

By Theorem <a href=\"#th:spec_LA_irrational_cantor\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"th:spec_LA_irrational_cantor\">10</a>, $\\sigma(L_{\\alpha,\\theta})$ is a Cantor set with Lebesgue measure zero. From it follows again that $\\sigma(L_{\\alpha,\\theta}) \\subset (-4, 4)$. Hence, since $\\eta$ is bicontinuous in each set $I_n$, $n \\geq 0$, the preimage $\\sigma_n = f^{(-1)}\\big(\\sigma(L_{\\alpha,\\theta})\\big) \\cap I_n$ (using the notation from Proposition <a href=\"#prop:spec:basic_for_original_op\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"prop:spec:basic_for_original_op\">3</a>) is again a Cantor set contained in $(-\\infty, 1)$ for $n=0$ and in $\\big(n^2, (n+1)^2\\big)$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, respectively. It is easy to see that the Lebesgue measure of $\\sigma_n$ is zero for every $n \\geq 0$ which implies that it is zero for the whole set.

    "text": "<div class=\"proof\">\n\n*Proof.* It follows from that $\\sigma(L_{\\alpha,\\theta}) \\subset (-4, 4)$. By the discussion preceding Proposition <a href=\"#prop:spec:basic_for_original_op\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"prop:spec:basic_for_original_op\">3</a> and with the same notation, it follows that for any $n \\geq 0$, $\\sigma_n$ is contained in some closed subinterval $J_n$ of $I_n$. Moreover, for $n>0$ the function $\\eta$ is bi-Lipschitz on $J_n$. Thus the inverse $(\\eta|_{J_n})^{(-1)}$ of its restriction on $J_n$ is again bi-Lipschitz. Hence $\\sigma_n$ is the image of $\\sigma(L_{\\alpha,\\theta})$ under bi-Lipschitz function $(\\eta|_{J_n})^{(-1)}$. It is a known fact, that bi-Lipschitz mappings preserve Hausdorff dimension, see e.g. . Hence $\\dim_H(\\sigma_n) = \\dim_H \\sigma(L_{\\alpha,\\theta})$ for all $n > 0$. For $n = 0$ we may argue similarly for any closed set contained in $J_0 \\setminus \\{0\\}$. The point $0$ should be omitted since $\\eta$ is not bi-Lipschitz on open sets containing zero. Let $H_0$ be a neighbourhood of $0$. Then $\\sigma_0 \\setminus H_0$ is an image of $\\sigma(L_{\\alpha,\\theta}) \\setminus \\eta(H_0)$ under a bi-Lipschitz function $(\\eta|_{J_0})^{(-1)}$. Since $H_0$ was arbitrary, it follows that $\\dim_H(\\sigma_0) = \\dim_H \\sigma(L_{\\alpha,\\theta})$. Finally, since countable sets have Hausdorff dimension zero, the countable stability, see e.g. Section 2.2 in , of Hausdorff measures yields the assertion. ◻\n\n</div>\n\nThus, by and , one more assertion follows.\n\n<div class=\"corollary\">\n\n**Corollary 15**. *Let $A_j = \\alpha j + \\theta$ for some $\\alpha, \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and every $j\\in\\mathbb{Z}$.

    "text": "# Concluding remarks\n\nTo conclude, recall first that for any irrational $\\alpha$ and (Lebesgue) almost all $\\theta$ the spectrum of the almost Mathieu operator $H_{\\alpha, 2, \\theta}$ is purely singularly continuous. This is a part of the more general Aubry-André conjecture proven by Jitomirskaya . This fact motivates us to the question whether for any irrational $\\alpha$ the spectrum of $L_{\\alpha,\\theta}$ has the same property, i.e. whether it is purely singularly continuous for Lebesgue a.e. $\\theta$.\n\nA deeper question concerns the physical meaning of the model that involves a magnetic field changing linearly along the chain. A philosophical answer could be, according the known quip of Bratelli and Robinson, that “validity of such idealizations is the heart and soul of theoretical physics and has the same fundamental significance as the reproducibility of experimental data”. On a more mundane level, one can note that the spectral behaviour will not change if the linear field is replaced by a quasiperiodic one which changes in a saw-tooth-like fashion as long as the jumps coincide with the graph vertices. This also opens an interesting question about the spectral form and type in case when the saw-tooth shape is replaced by another periodic or quasiperiodic function.",

    "text": "It is natural in this context to define the *exponential decay rate in expectation* (obviously connected to the minimal inverse correlation length) as\n\n$$\\label{gamma}\n \\gamma := \\liminf_{k\\to\\infty}\\left( -\\frac{\\ln {\\mathbb E}(\\sum_{s} |\\varphi_s(0)|\\cdot |\\varphi_s (k)|)}{|k|}\\right)$$ with a relevant question being whether or not it is positive. This definition can be localized to an energy range by summing over the eigenfunctions with energies falling in the range, in which case it is linked to the minimal inverse correlation length for Fermi energies falling in that range.\n\nThe corresponding question for the *Anderson model*, i.e. for the potential being independent identically distributed random variables, was solved in for the one-dimensional case and in for higher dimensions throughout the regimes where corresponding proofs of localization work, thus establishing positivity of $\\gamma.$. The corresponding result for continuum operators was proven in .\n\nIn this paper we establish the first result of this type for a non-random ergodic operator.[^3] The most natural and popular operator that fits this description is the almost Mathieu operator given by $$\\label{am}\\begin{split}\n H_{\\lambda,\\alpha,\\theta} : \\ell^2({\\mathbb Z}) &\\to\\ell^2({\\mathbb Z}),\\\\\n H_{\\lambda,\\alpha,\\theta} u(n) &= u(n+1) + u(n-1) + 2 \\lambda \\cos(2\\pi(n\\alpha + \\theta)) u(n),\n\\end{split}$$ where $\\lambda > 0$, $\\alpha$ is irrational, $\\theta \\in {\\mathbb R}$, and $\\ell^2({\\mathbb Z})$ denotes the space of square summable bi-infinite sequences. We will be interested in the supercritical regime that is $\\lambda > 1,$ which is the regime of localization for almost every value of $(\\alpha,\\theta)$.\n\nThe frequency $\\alpha$ is Diophantine if there exist $\\kappa, \\tau > 0$ such that $$\\|q\\alpha\\| = \\mathop{\\mathrm{dist}}(q\\alpha, {\\mathbb Z}) \\geq \\frac{\\kappa}{q^{\\tau}}$$ for all integers $q \\geq 1$. We will also use the notation $0\\leq \\beta(\\alpha) := \\limsup -\\frac{\\ln  \\|q\\alpha\\|}{q},$ so $\\beta(\\alpha)=0$ for Diophantine $\\alpha.$ Frequencies $\\alpha$ with small $\\beta(\\alpha)$ (with the quantifier depending on the context) are often called weakly Liouville. It was shown in that for $\\lambda > 1$ and $\\alpha$ Diophantine *Anderson localization* holds, that is for almost every $\\theta \\in {\\mathbb R}$, the operator $H_{\\lambda,\\alpha,\\theta}$ has pure point spectrum with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions. This has been extended to the weakly Liouville case in .\n\nAs far as quantum dynamics goes, the following dynamical statements are known:\n\n1.  Jitomirskaya and Last have shown in that for $\\lambda > \\frac{15}{2}$, $\\alpha$ Diophantine, and almost every $\\theta$ we have $$\\sup_{t\\in{\\mathbb R}} |\\langle \\delta_k , \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}t H_{\\lambda,\\alpha,\\theta}} \\delta_{\\ell} \\rangle|\n        \\leq C \\mathrm{e}^{-\\gamma |k - \\ell|}$$ where $\\gamma > 0$ is independent of $\\theta$, $k$, and $\\ell$, but $C > 0$ is allowed to depend on $\\theta$ and $\\ell$, but is independent of $k$.\n\n2.  Germinet and Jitomirskaya have shown in that for $\\lambda > 1$ and $\\alpha$ Diophantine, we have that for every $q > 1$ $$\\int_{0}^{1} \\sup_{t} \\sum_{n\\in{\\mathbb Z}} (1 + |n|)^{q}\n       |\\langle \\delta_n , \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}t H_{\\lambda,\\alpha,\\theta}} \\delta_0 \\rangle| d\\theta\n        <\\infty.$$ This property is called *strong dynamical localization* in and a number of publications on the Anderson model and quasiperiodic operators. As the conclusion of Theorem <a href=\"#thm:main\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"thm:main\">1</a> is stronger a better name might be *polynomial dynamical localization in expectation*.\n\n3.  It is known since that a Diophantine-type assumption is necessary even for spectral localization.\n\n4.  Bourgain and Jitomirskaya have proven dynamical localization results of the type (ii) for more general quasi-periodic models.\n\nIn this note we prove the above described exponential rate of decay for supercritical almost Mathieu operator with Diophantine (and even weakly Liouville) frequencies:\n\n<div id=\"thm:main\" class=\"theorem\">\n\n**Theorem 1**. *Let $\\lambda > 1.$ Then there exists $\\beta >0$ such that for $\\alpha$ with $\\beta(\\alpha)<\\beta$ we have $\\gamma>0$ with $\\gamma$ defined in (<a href=\"#gamma\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"gamma\">[gamma]</a>).*\n\n</div>\n\nThis immediately implies\n\n<div id=\"cor:main\" class=\"corollary\">\n\n**Corollary 2**. *Under the conditions of Theorem <a href=\"#thm:main\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"thm:main\">1</a> there exists $\\gamma > 0$ and $C > 0$ such that $$\\int_{0}^{1} \\sup_{t\\in{\\mathbb R}} |\\langle \\delta_{\\ell} , \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}t H_{\\lambda,\\alpha,\\theta}} \\delta_{k} \\rangle| d\\theta\n    \\leq C \\mathrm{e}^{-\\gamma |k-\\ell|}$$ for all $k,\\ell \\in{\\mathbb Z}$.*\n\n</div>\n\nThe conclusion of this corollary can be best called *exponential dynamical localization in expectation*. It is clear that this result implies both the results of and . The proof of Theorem <a href=\"#thm:main\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"thm:main\">1</a> is based on the results of . As the bounds on eigenfunction decay obtained in are nonquantitative also our bounds on $\\gamma$ are.\n\nIt is an interesting and natural question if the limit in the right-hand side of (<a href=\"#gamma\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"gamma\">[gamma]</a>) exists in general and if for one dimensional operators $\\gamma$ can be equal to the minimal Lyapunov exponent as that is how the eigenfunctions often decay (for the Diophantine almost Mathieu case the almost Lyapunov decay of the eigenfunctions was shown in ). We plan to investigate this question in a future work. It is also interesting to establish positive decay rate for other well-studied models with localization, for example, for other quasiperiodic operators in the regime of positive Lyapunov exponents.\n\nThe proof of Theorem <a href=\"#thm:main\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"thm:main\">1</a> splits into two parts. In Section <a href=\"#sec:redef\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"sec:redef\">2</a>, we reduce the question to a question of decay estimates of eigenfunctions with a given localization center. As we hope that the results will be useful in other contexts, we formulate this section for general families of operators acting on $\\ell^2({\\mathbb Z}^d)$. In Section <a href=\"#sec:al\" data-reference-type=\"ref\" data-reference=\"sec:al\">3</a>, we deduce the appropriate decay estimate from the results of .\n\n# Reduction to a question about eigenfunctions\n\nAs the results in the following are valid for general families of operators, we state them in this generality. Let $\\{H_x\\}_{x\\in X}$ be a family of self-adjoint operators on $\\ell^2({\\mathbb Z}^d),$ and $(X,\\mu)$ a probability space. Assume that for $\\mu$ almost every $x\\in X$ the spectrum of $H_x$ is pure point. Denote by $\\varphi_{x;s}$ an orthonormal basis of $\\ell^2({\\mathbb Z}^d)$ consisting of eigenfunctions of $H_x$. For each $\\varphi_{x; s}$, we let $n_{x;s} \\in{\\mathbb Z}^d$ be such that $$|\\varphi_{x;s}(n_{x;s})| = \\| \\varphi_{x;s}\\|_{\\ell^{\\infty}({\\mathbb Z}^d)}.$$ It is shown for $d=1$ in Section 2 of . that $\\varphi_{x;s}$ and $n_{x;s}$ can be chosen to be measurable functions of $x$. The general case can be found in .\n\nFixing $\\lambda > 1$ and $\\alpha$ with $\\beta(\\alpha)$ sufficiently small, the results of imply that the family of operators $\\{H_{\\lambda,\\alpha,\\theta}\\}_{\\theta\\in [0,1]}$ satisfy the above properties when $[0,1]$ is equipped with the normalized Lebesgue measure.\n\nWe state the next theorem in a form more general than is necessary for application to the almost Mathieu operator. It is our hope that it will be useful in other contexts. The main difference to a more naive estimate is that one can exploit the orthogonality of the $\\varphi_{x;s}$ when estimating $\\sum_{n_{x;s} = n} |\\varphi_{x;s}(\\ell)|^2$.\n\n<div id=\"thm:A\" class=\"theorem\">\n\n**Theorem 3**. *We have for almost every $x$ that $$\\begin{split}\n |\\langle \\delta_k , \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}t H_x} \\delta_{\\ell} \\rangle| \n&\\leq \\sum_{s} |\\overline{\\varphi_{x;s}(k)} \\varphi_{x;s}(\\ell)| \\\\\n\\nonumber&\\leq \\sum_{n}   \\left( \\sum_{n_{x;s} = n} |\\overline{\\varphi_{x;s}(k)}|^2 \n    \\sum_{n_{x;s} = n} |\\varphi_{x;s}(\\ell)|^2\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n \\end{split}$$ and $$\\begin{split}\n  \\int |\\langle \\delta_k , \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}t H_x} \\delta_{\\ell} \\rangle| d\\mu(x)&\n   \\leq \\int \\sum_{s} |\\overline{\\varphi_{x;s}(k)} \\varphi_{x;s}(\\ell)| d\\mu(x) \\\\\n\\nonumber& \\leq \\sum_{n} \\left(\\int \\sum_{n_{x;s} = n} |\\varphi_{x;s}(k)|^2 d\\mu(x)\n    \\int \\sum_{n_{x;s} = n} |\\varphi_{x;s}(\\ell)|^2 d\\mu(x)\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\n \\end{split}$$*\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"proof\">\n\n*Proof.* Denote by $E_{x;s}$ the eigenvalues of $H_x$ such that $H_x \\varphi_{x;s} = E_{x;s} \\varphi_{x;s}$.

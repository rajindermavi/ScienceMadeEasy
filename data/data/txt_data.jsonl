In other words, for the skew-shift, these results are expected to be independent of the size of the disorder . Hence one expects that if , the Lyapunov exponent is positive and Anderson localization holds for all energies.

More specifically, they imply existence of almost periodic solutions to the quantum kicked rotator equation. However, one has to establish (dynamical) localization for a more general, long range operator, one where the discrete Laplacian is replaced by a Toeplitz operator with fast off-diagonal decay of its monodromy matrix entries.

The unitary update rule of this quantum walk shares many spectral characteristics with the critical Almost-Mathieu Operator; however, it possesses a feature not present in the Almost-Mathieu Operator, namely singularity of the associated cocycles (this feature is, however, present in the so-called Extended Harper's Model). We show that this operator has empty absolutely continuous spectrum and that the Lyapunov exponent vanishes on the spectrum; hence, this model exhibits Cantor spectrum of zero Lebesgue measure for all irrational frequencies and arbitrary phase, which in physics is known as Hofstadter's butterfly. In fact, we will show something stronger, namely, that all spectral parameters in the spectrum are of critical type, in the language of Avila's global theory of analytic quasiperiodic cocycles. We further prove that it has empty point spectrum for each irrational frequency and away from a frequency-dependent set of phases having Lebesgue measure zero. The key ingredients in our proofs are an adaptation of Avila's Global Theory to the present setting, self-duality via the Fourier transform, and a Johnson-type theorem for singular dynamically defined CMV matrices which characterizes their spectra as the set of spectral parameters at which the associated cocycles fail to admit a dominated splitting.\n\nIntroduction", "text_len": 1527, "token_estimate": 381, "has_math_loss": false, "labels": [], "neighbors": [{"id": "1512.07641v1::L5-106::c0", "direction": "previous"}, {"id": "1512.07641v1::L118-120::c2", "direction": "next"}], "meta": {"source": "plain_text", "source_kind": "plain_text"}, "harvest": {"arxiv_ids": [], "emails": [], "urls": []}, "added_at": 1759641037, "version": "pptxt-0.1"}

In particular, this connection enables one to translate questions about the dynamics of a quantum walk into questions about the spectral theory of CMV matrices and OPUC, a subject for which an enormous number of powerful tools exist; see, e.g.,.\n\nIn the present paper, we will study a particular one-dimensional coined quantum walk with quasi-periodically distributed coins.

We will show that these operators share many spectral characteristics with the critical AMO, such as purely singular continuous spectrum supported on a Cantor set of zero Lebesgue measure.

Thus the occurrence of critical energies is a very rare phenomenon. In fact, before our model in the present paper, the only operators known to display critical energies are the critical Almost Mathieu Operator (i.e. the operator given by schrodingeroperators with potential function , which is also known as Harper's Model), and the extended Harper's Model.

In Section , we collect some useful background information and definitions. Section  discusses Aubry duality for the present model. In Section , we discuss the spectral type. We begin by proving Theorem .. Next, we exploit Aubry duality to prove that the spectral type is purely continuous for all frequencies and almost all phases, which completes the proof of Theorem .. In Section , we use global theory for singular one-frequency quasiperiodic cocycles to prove that the Lyapunov exponent vanishes on the spectrum. When combined with Kotani theory and the singular nature of the spectrum, this yields the conclusion of Theorem ., namely, that the spectrum is a Cantor set of zero Lebesgue measure. In Section , we work out an essential ingredient in our application of global theory, namely, a version of the theorem of Johnson for singular CMV matrices which identifies the resolvent set with the set of spectral parameters at which the associated matrix cocycles enjoy a dominated splitting.

Note, however, that  for all , so e.umatrixrep and e.ecmvoddzero may not match exactly when  is not real and nonnegative. However, this can be easily resolved by conjugation with a suitable diagonal unitary; the interested reader is referred to for details.\n\nIn fact, in Section , we will define a class of generalized CMV matrices which includes both the standard formalism for CMV matrices and the operators that correspond to the quantum walks considered in the present paper. In particular, for our purposes later, let us also describe another factorization of , which is closely tied to the usual  factorization of CMV matrices.

Then\n\nAubry Duality for the Unitary AMO\n\nIn this section, we will discuss two versions of Aubry duality for the unitary Almost-Mathieu Operator. The first version expresses a classical version of duality between eigenfunctions and Bloch waves, while the second is a slightly more abstract framework which shows how (direct integrals of) the coin and shift operators are dual to one another via the Fourier transform. For the spectral analysis in the present paper, we only need the first version of duality. However, we explicitly work out the second version for two reasons. First, this second version is clearly a natural analogue of the usual Aubry duality transform, which has been extremely useful in the spectral analysis of the self-adjoint AMO as shown in. Secondly, this version reflects how some authors think about duality in the physics literature. Concretely, this version of duality puts the heuristic discussion in on a firm mathematical foundation.\n\nTo describe the first version of duality, let us define the inverse Fourier transform of a sequence  by\n\nAdditionally, for , we denote its Fourier transform by\n\nGiven , let us use eq:typicalelt to view it as a pair of  sequences  and .

On the mathematical side the\nquestion was translated into the analysis of the almost Mathieu\nequation which culminated recently in the proof of the \"Ten Martini\nProblem\" by Avila and Jitomirskaya.

A philosophical answer could be, according the known quip of Bratelli and Robinson, that \"validity of such idealizations is the heart and soul of theoretical physics and has the same fundamental significance as the reproducibility of experimental data\". On a more mundane level, one can note that the spectral behaviour will not change if the linear field is replaced by a quasiperiodic one which changes in a saw-tooth-like fashion as long as the jumps coincide with the graph vertices. This also opens an interesting question about the spectral form and type in case when the saw-tooth shape is replaced by another periodic or quasiperiodic function.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are obliged to Konstantin Pankrashkin for his constructive\ncriticism which helped to improve the manuscript.

For shifts\non a one-dimensional torus  most of the results have been\nestablished non-perturbatively, i.e., either in the regime of almost\nreducibility or in the regime of positive Lyapunov exponent, and\nAvila's global theory, see, gives a qualitative spectral\npicture, covering both regimes, for generic potentials. One of the\nmain results of the one-dimensional theory is the fact that the\nspectrum is a Cantor set. For the case of the almost Mathieu operator\n(corresponding to a cosine potential), this result has been proved for\nany non-zero coupling and any irrational shift, see\nand. For general analytic\npotentials in the regime of positive Lyapunov\nexponent with generic shift the Cantor structure of the spectrum has\nbeen obtained in.\n\nOn the other\nhand, shifts on a multidimensional torus  turned out to be\nharder to analyze and the theory is less developed, even in the\nperturbative setting.\nIn particular, not much is known about the geometry of the spectrum\nfor multidimensional shifts.  In their pioneering paper\n, Chulaevsky and Sinai conjectured that in contrast to\nthe shift on the one-dimensional torus, for the two-dimensional shift\nthe spectrum can be an interval for generic large smooth\npotentials.

In this paper we prove this conjecture for large analytic potentials.\n\nHeuristically, gaps in the spectrum of the one-frequency\noperators are created by horizontal \"forbidden\nzones\" appearing at the points of  intersection of the graphs of shifted finite\nscale eigenvalues parametrized by phase,\nsee . In contrast to this, the heuristic\nprinciple underlying is that for multiple frequencies, the intersection curves\nof the  graphs of shifted finite scale\neigenvalues may not be too flat, thus preventing the appearance of the  horizontal  \"forbidden\nzones\" and stopping the formation of gaps.  It is clear that some genericity\nassumption on the potential function is needed for this to be true,\nsince potentials like  lead to flat intersection curves\nand have Cantor spectrum. Furthermore, the largeness of the potential\nis also needed. Indeed, it is known that for small potentials with\natypical frequency vector the spectrum has gaps, see.\n\nImplementing such an argument, appears to be very challenging for a\nnumber of reasons.

This issue, commonly referred to as double resonances,  is well-known.\nSimilar strategies, leading to the formation of intervals in the\nspectrum, have been implemented for the skew-shift\nin  and for continuous two-dimensional Schrodinger\noperators in .\nThe main new device that we develop in this work,  consists of an elimination of double resonances for all\nshifts , and not just the \"arithmetic ones\" . Of course the shift  cannot be too small.\nAlthough this problem looks  less accessible, it  turns out to provide more control on the  resonant set  of the previous scale.\nThe level sets  of the potential in question must satisfy the requirements of this more general elimination in order to launch the multi-scale analysis.\nThis is exactly the origin of our main condition on the potential, see Definition  below.\n\nFurthermore, in order to show that the spectrum is actually an\ninterval,  we develop a Cartan type estimate that\ncontrols the intersections of the level sets of an analytic function\nnear a non-degenerate extremum with their shifts.", "text_len": 2469, "token_estimate": 617, "has_math_loss": false, "labels": [], "neighbors": [{"id": "1708.09711v1::L171-197::c2", "direction": "previous"}, {"id": "1708.09711v1::L233-285::c4", "direction": "next"}], "meta": {"source": "plain_text", "source_kind": "plain_text"}, "harvest": {"arxiv_ids": [], "emails": [], "urls": []}, "added_at": 1759641037, "version": "pptxt-0.1"}

At the same time,  various physically desirable conclusions, such as e.g. the\nexponential decay of the two-point function at the ground state and\npositive temperatures with correlation length staying uniformly\nbounded as temperature goes to zero, are often\nimplicitly assumed as attributes of localization. A way\nto derive them currently requires a strong form of dynamical\nlocalization: the exponential (in space) rate of decay of\nthe two point function,\nthat is\n\nwhere\nis a complete set of orthonormalized eigenfunctions (and the sum may\nbe localized in energy, if needed).\n\nIn view of this, the exponential decay rate in expectation was\ndefined  in as", "text_len": 1798, "token_estimate": 449, "has_math_loss": true, "labels": [], "neighbors": [{"id": "1812.02860v1::L79-112::c1", "direction": "next"}], "meta": {"source": "plain_text", "source_kind": "plain_text"}, "harvest": {"arxiv_ids": [], "emails": ["USAliuwencai1226@gmail.com", "helge@caltech.edu", "szhitomi@math.uci.edu"], "urls": []}, "added_at": 1759641038, "version": "pptxt-0.1"}

First, positive Lyapunov exponents\ndon't even imply pure point spectrum for a.e. phase. Even\nfor models with positive Lyapunov exponents and known pure point spectrum, dynamical localization\nmay not hold, and then an averaged statement (dubbed\nstrong dynamical localization) is\nstrictly stronger, and a result such as\nedl is stronger yet (albeit equivalent in all known\nexamples so far).\n\nYet it may be natural to expect that there is a certain reason to\nphysicists' jump in conclusions, and that for physically relevant\nmodels Lyapunov exponent is indeed related to .\n\nIn this paper we prove the first such result.

In mathematics, it is universally called the critical almost Mathieu\noperator.(This name was originally introduced by Barry Simon\n.) In addition to importance in physics, this model is of\nspecial interest, being at the boundary of two reasonably well\nunderstood regimes: (almost) localization and (almost) reducibility,\nand not being amenable to methods of either side. Recently, there has been some\nprogress in the study of the fine structure of its spectrum.\n\nDenote the spectrum of an operator  as a set, by .

Buslaev and A. Fedotov suggested  the monodromization\nmethod, one more renormalization approach that arose when trying to use\nthe Bloch-Floquet theory ideas to study the geometry of the spectrum of\ndifference operators  in . The method was further\ndeveloped by A.Fedotov and F.Klopp when studying adiabatic quasiperiodic\noperators. More details can be found in review . The\nmonodromization method can be used for one-dimensional two-frequency\ndifference and differential quasiperiodic operators independently  of any\nassumptions on  the continued fraction. If such an equation contains an\nasymptotic parameter, one can effectively describe the asymptotic geometry\nof the spectrum.\nIn  we described how to apply the monodromization method to\nget a constructive asymptotic description of the spectrum  as a Cantor set\nin the case studied by B. Helffer and J. Sjostrand. The present paper is\nthe first step to a similar constructive asymptotic description in the\ncase of a small coupling constant. Here, we make only the first\nrenormalization. This allows to describe asymptotically a series of the\nlongest spectral gaps. We get asymptotic formulas for the gap centers and\nlower bounds for the gap lengths.

Our definition is based on a class of self-similar Laplacians instead of the standard discrete Laplacian, and  includes the classical almost Mathieu operators as a particular case. Our main result establishes that the spectra of these  self-similar almost Mathieu operators can be described by the spectra of the corresponding  self-similar Laplacians through the spectral decimation framework used in the context of spectral analysis on fractals. The spectral type of the self-similar Laplacians used in our model are singularly continuous.

Subsequently, Hofstadter observed that the spectra of the AMO can be fractal sets. We refer to for more early examples of such operators whose spectra are Cantor-like sets, and to\nfor more results on the AMO and references therein.\n\nIndependently,  a line of investigations of self-similar Laplacian operators on graphs, fractals, and networks has emerged. A fundamental tool in this framework is the spectral decimation method, initially  used in physics to compute the spectrum of the Laplacian on a Sierpinski lattice. At the heart of this method is the fact that  the spectrum of this Laplacian  is completely described in terms of iterations of a rational function. For an overview of the modern mathematical approaches, applications, and extensions of the spectral decimation methods we refer to  and references therein.\n\nRecently, Chen and Teplyaev used the general framework of the spectral decimation method to investigate the appearnce of the singular continuous spectrum of a family of Laplacian operators. One of the   ideas used in establishing this result is that these Laplacians are naturally related to self-similar operators  with corresponding self-similar structures which allows to use complex dynamics techniques.\n\nThe present paper is a first in what we expect to be a research program dealing with quasi-periodic Schrodinger-type operators  on self-similar sets such as fractals and graphs.

We refer to this class of operators as piecewise centrosymmetric Jacobi operators .\nIn this general setting we show that the spectral decimation function arises from a  particular system of orthogonal polynomials associated with the aforementioned Jacobi matrix. In particular, this spectral decimation function is computable using a three-term recursion formula associated to this system of orthogonal polynomials. In the process, we avoid the Schur complement computation that could involve resolvent calculations of large matrices. Additionally, the general setting we consider incan be further extended to higher-dimensional graphs and would allow us to define Jacobi-type operators on graphs like the Sierpinski lattices or Diamond graphs. We plan to use this approach to investigate some of the questions in.\n\nSelf-similar Laplacians and almost Mathieu operators In this section we introduce the notations and the definition of the self-similar structure we impose on the half-integer lattice.

Our main conclusions are the following.\n\nTheorem  presents a useful algebraic tool to relate the spectrum of the almost Mathieu operators   to that of a family of self-similar Laplacians . Our results are established when the parameter  belongs to the dense set  where . Note that in the classical case, corresponding to  in our formulation, many important results   are also obtained  for  irrational, but in the fractal setting the methods for irrational  are not developed yet.\n\nThe method of spectral similarity is applicable in many situations, and in a forthcoming work we develop a general framework by working with  a large class of Jacobi operators. We call these operators piecewise centrosymmetric Jacobi operators .\nIn this general setting   the spectral decimation function can be computed using the theory of   orthogonal polynomials associated with the aforementioned Jacobi matrix.

In particular, we proved in theorem  an explicit formula connecting   the density of states of   by identifying it with the weighted preimages of the balanced invariant measure on the Julia set of the polynomial  .

This result requires a detailed analysis of a certain dynamical system describing the behavior of the generalized eigenfunction.\n\nA particular novelty of our results is that we develop the spectral analysis of a self-similar Laplacian with a quasi-periodic potential.

In certain particular situations this allows to consider classical and quantum wave prorogation on fractal and other irregular structures.\n\nUsing these Harmonic Analysis tools, our work introduces a direct approach to the  gap labeling for a self-similar Laplacian with a potential. In particular, this   direct approach   for gap labeling is complementing. In our case we do not make use of the   dual of a group acting on the fractal lattice, and observe that gap labels of the form  are consistent  with the self-similar quasi-periodic structure where renormalization acts by the dilation of the space  by . This should be contrasted with the gap labeling for fractal structures with more complicated topological structure currently under investigation in, including the classical Sierpinski gasket and a new model of the bubble diamond fractals. In general, on a certain class of self-similar structures the gaps  are labeled by the values of the\nintegrated density of states of the Laplacian with values  where  is the topological degree of the self-covering map of the fractal limit space.\nThus, our work  sets the stage for considering the Bloch theorem, noncommutative Chern characters and fractal-based quantum Hall systems, see  , as well as.

It is not clear if arithmetic Anderson localization could be expected for other potentials.\nThe main purpose of this paper is to present a new method from the point of view of dynamical systems  to prove the arithmetic version of Anderson localization for quasiperiodic Schrodinger operators.

We exhibit a version of Aubry-Andre duality for this model, which partitions the parameter space into three regions: a supercritical region and a subcritical region that are dual to one another, and a critical regime that is self-dual. In each parameter region, we characterize the cocycle dynamics of the transfer matrix cocycle generated by the associated generalized eigenvalue equation. In particular, we show that supercritical, critical, and subcritical behavior all occur in this model. Using Avila's global theory of one-frequency cocycles, we exactly compute the Lyapunov exponent on the spectrum in terms of the given parameters. We also characterize the spectral type for each value of the coupling constant, almost every frequency, and almost every phase. Namely, we show that for almost every frequency and every phase the spectral type is purely absolutely continuous in the subcritical region, pure point in the supercritical region, and purely singular continuous in the critical region. In some parameter regions, we refine the almost-sure results. In the critical case for instance, we show that the spectrum is a Cantor set of zero Lebesgue measure for arbitrary irrational frequency and that the spectrum is purely singular continuous for all but countably many phases.\n\nKeywords: Quantum Walks, Almost Mathieu Operator, Spectral Theory, Unitary Dynamics, CMV matrices, OPUC, Aubry duality.", "text_len": 1839, "token_estimate": 459, "has_math_loss": false, "labels": [], "neighbors": [{"id": "2112.03216v2::L5-93::c0", "direction": "previous"}, {"id": "2112.03216v2::L112-115::c2", "direction": "next"}], "meta": {"source": "plain_text", "source_kind": "plain_text"}, "harvest": {"arxiv_ids": [], "emails": ["darrenong@xmu.edu.mydarrenong"], "urls": []}, "added_at": 1759641038, "version": "pptxt-0.1"}

They have intrinsic mathematical interest and are important in physics, where they serve as models for the quantum evolution of single particles with internal degrees of freedom and bounded hopping length on a lattice or graph. In this context, quantum walks were shown to exhibit many single and few particle effects, such as ballistic motion, decoherence, dynamical localization, and the formation of bound states. Recently, quantum walks were shown to provide a testbed for symmetry protected topological order and bulk-boundary correspondence with a complete set of indices that are stable under compact as well as norm-continuous perturbations. Complementary to this, quantum walks can be viewed as quantum mechanical analogues of classical random walks. Their increased ballistic spreading compared to classical diffusion makes them interesting for applications in quantum computing such as the element distinctiveness problem, universal quantum computation, and search algorithms.\n\nFrom a mathematical point of view, a quantum walk is given by a unitary operator  acting in a suitable Hilbert space with an underlying lattice or graph structure.

We are motivated by work on electrons moving in a two-dimensional lattice under the influence of a uniform magnetic field, a physical system that has been intensively studied in recent decades; compare, e.g.,. The almost-Mathieu operator (and more generally the extended Harper's model) is one example of a model of an electron in a magnetic field, which inspired intense study in mathematics; see\nand references therein for a partial list. Despite the ostensible simplicity of the setup, the properties of this system are rich and deep, requiring extensive analysis to understand fully.\n\nMotivated by this, we discuss in this paper two-dimensional quantum walks in homogeneous magnetic fields, which are constructed via a discrete analogue of minimal coupling.

Their model is given as a one-dimensional quantum walk, and each such walk is known to be equivalent to a CMV matrix which in turn is specified by a sequence  of Verblunsky coefficients in . In the CMV setting, it seems natural to introduce a coupling constant by multiplying the Verblunsky coefficients by a scalar ; however, this does not lead to fruitful results in the present setting. See also the discussion in, especially item 14 in Section B.1. Indeed, Simon says therein that the lack of suitable coupling constants \"impacted my ability to discuss almost periodic Verblunsky coefficients\", which suggests that our novel method of incorporating a coupling constant will have applications in other models.\n\nLet us also point out: as a result of this connection, every result in our paper can be translated into a result about a suitable CMV matrix.

We have chosen to formulate our work in terms of quantum walks, since that makes the origin of the model more transparent.\n\nThe first main ingredient in the proofs of our results is the classification of cocycle dynamics: in the nomenclature of Avila, we classify the matrix cocycle induced by the stationary equation of the walk (cf. eq:AlambdaCocycleDef) and show that it is subcritical on the spectrum when , supercritical on the spectrum when , and critical on the spectrum when . This discussion sweeps a few technicalities under the rug; the transfer matrix cocycle is not always well-defined for some values of the parameters and hence one works with a suitable regularization whose dynamics one can then characterize in the global theory scheme.\n\nThe second key ingredient is a suitable version of duality via a Fourier-type transform (cf. Theorems  and ); in analogy with the setting of Harper's model, we call this \"Aubry duality\". Up to a transpose, the duality transformation exchanges the coupling constants  and , which enables one to translate suitable reducibility or localization statements from one parameter region to another. In particular, the operators described herein are quasiperiodic unitary operators that obey a version of Aubry duality, and thus this work addresses a query from Li-Damanik-Zhou .  The form of duality enables one to show that all three spectral types (absolutely continuous, singular continuous, and pure point) occur within the non self-dual regimes.\n\nAs a byproduct of our model and the detailed cocycle analysis, we produce a family of quasiperiodic unitaries with positive Lyapunov exponents in certain parameter regions.

In order to achieve this while still keeping the length of the paper in check, we have aimed to spend less time on techniques and tools that are obvious generalizations from the self-adjoint setting in order to supply full details for problems that present genuine challenges and required more novel solutions.\n\nLet us describe a few of the challenges. First, due to singularities that arise at complex phases in the non-critical cases, the transfer matrix cocycle is singular and hence one cannot immediately use the \"asymptotic cocycle\" method as in previous cases to compute the Lyapunov exponent. We use a topological argument to circumvent this difficulty: we show that the range of the determinant of the cocycle map has trivial winding around the origin in the two \"perturbative\" regions of large and small imaginary parts and use suitable continuity arguments to establish this for all imaginary parts away from the singularities. This is inspired by related works of Jitmirskaya-Marx for the (self-adjoint) extended Harper's model.\n\nThe calculations needed to establish the form of Aubry duality are quite delicate and require several non-obvious changes of coordinates. More generally, because of the more complicated structure of the operator and its transfer matrices, most calculations are more involved than the corresponding self-adjoint counterparts. Furthermore, as mentioned before, it is also not obvious what these analogous calculations should be.\n\nIn the proof of continuous spectrum for the case of critical coupling, we need to deal with the lack of a symplectic symmetry of the cocycle. Concretely, we had to find a novel symmetry of the cocycle which was then different from the symplectic symmetry that is typically used in studying reducibility questions for Schrodinger cocycles. In the Schrodinger setting, one can simply exploit the fact that the transfer matrix is real and so invariant under complex conjugation, whereas the corresponding symmetry we had to use was more complicated.", "text_len": 2494, "token_estimate": 623, "has_math_loss": false, "labels": [], "neighbors": [{"id": "2112.03216v2::L137-144::c6", "direction": "previous"}, {"id": "2112.03216v2::L153-157::c8", "direction": "next"}], "meta": {"source": "plain_text", "source_kind": "plain_text"}, "harvest": {"arxiv_ids": [], "emails": [], "urls": []}, "added_at": 1759641038, "version": "pptxt-0.1"}

However, even after normalization, the cocycle for this model clearly does not belong to ; nevertheless, we found a novel conjugacy from the cocycle into , which again is not at all obvious from the form of the cocycle.\n\nFinally, our operators are not standard CMV matrices but rather generalized CMV matrices, which allow for an additional complex phase in some parameters. This obstacle is the easiest to overcome: any generalized CMV matrix is unitarily equivalent to a genuine CMV matrix by a simple diagonal unitary operator. This allows one to translate results from CMV matrices to generalized CMV matrices with relative ease. For the reader's convenience, we describe this equivalence in Section . This will be discussed more thoroughly together with some additional applications in the forthcoming work.\n\nWe wish to emphasize that, although there are often corresponding results on either the unitary or self-adjoint side, such results are often about classes of operators (periodic, random, quasiperiodic), and not specific models.

As we were finalizing this paper we learned of a preprint  where the study of the numerators also plays an important  role, but in a completely different setting of unbounded potentials and  the so-called anti-resonances.\n\nWe say a  phase  is completely resonant with respect to a  frequency  if . One of the motivations   to study  completely resonant phases   is their critical roles in the spectral theory of quasiperiodic Schrodinger operators, for instance, spectral gap edges  . Another motivation comes from a conjecture of\nAvila and Jitomirskaya in     and Jitomirskaya  .\n\nConjecture 1: Avila and Jitomirskaya    conjectured   that the almost Mathieu operator   satisfies Anderson localization  if   and  ,\nwhere\n\nand  .\n\nConjecture 1  is also  a particular case of a conjecture  of Jitomirskaya   .\nIn this paper, we prove Conjecture 1 as it is.\nAssume that     satisfies .

However, such an argument  does not work  for resonant sites  (only coming from phase resonances) since the  repetition of potentials only appears at sites  by the   continued fraction expansion approximation. We regard  norms of generalized eigenfunctions at resonant sites   and numerators of  Green's functions around  resonant sites  as variables.\nOur first step is to establish inequalities among those variables.  By solving those inequalities, we obtain the relations among resonant sites.

For instance, it is clear that an estimate of the form eq:rhosymm is needed to obtain useful estimates on the quantities in, for example, eq:longWronskiCalc and lem:25:Phiipm0setup. Thus, in addition to the identity eq:alphasymm for the 's, one also must have a symmetry of the type eq:rhosymm for the 's, and such a symmetry cannot hold for standard CMV matrices, so one absolutely must complexify to reveal the necessary symmetry.\nIn fact, as the reader will see, even with the new ideas using gauge transforms to relate to the complexified  case, the computations are somewhat more laborious in the present setting. For instance, one may compare the proof of Lemma  to the corresponding computation in. Similarly, the absence of symplectic symmetry (even after complexification) makes the comparison of \"reflected\" and inverted transfer matrices quite delicate\nIf  satisfies eq:VCbd, then the hypothesis of Theorem  is fulfilled whenever  is even and real-valued.\nThe largeness condition on  is concrete.

For an in-depth overview over the development we refer the reader to the surveys.\n\nThe \"Dry Ten Martini Problem\" originally asks the natural follow up question: are all gaps in the spectrum of the AMO open? Over the years, substantial partial progress for various subsets of parameters was made by Choi-Elliott-Yui, Puig, Avila-Jitomirskaya and Avila-You-Zhou, yet, the critical case  with  a Diophantine number is still open. Of course, one can ask the (Dry) Ten Martini Problem for any model of interest. Recent progress has been made for the extended Harper's model, Sturmian Hamiltonians and - and -type sampling functions. Research along this line turns out to be very fruitful, for example, the discovery of a robust property or the construction of explicit examples.\n\nWe mention in passing that one might take another step in the direction of abstraction and ask the question, how, for a family of random operators defined over an ergodic dynamical system, the base dynamics determines the topological structure of the almost sure spectrum. Clearly, the Dry Ten Martini Problem is a special case of this \"all gaps open\" problem. As for operators with quasiperiodic base dynamics such as the AMO, the set of possible gap labels is determined by the so-called Gap Labeling Theorem.

On the other hand, whenever one has this duality available for a concrete operator, one can expect the Dry Ten Martini problem to hold.\n\nWe here solve the Dry Ten Martini Problem for a model that goes beyond the class of quasiperiodic Schrödinger operators but for which one nevertheless can prove an André-Aubry duality: the so-called unitary almost Mathieu operator (UAMO) is a quantum walk that describes the motion of a single particle with two-dimensional internal degree of freedom on the integers in discrete time steps.

The UAMO is a split-step quantum walk  on  that is defined in terms of two operators:\nis the conditional shift operator\n*\nand  is a \"coin\" operator that acts coordinate-wise via a  unitary . For the UAMO, these local coins are quasi-periodically distributed according to the rule\n\nwhere  denotes a modified counterclockwise rotation through the angle , i.e.,\n\nand we abbreviated .\n\nWith these two building blocks, the UAMO is defined as\n\nand we shall abbreviate as  for fixed  and .\nAs discussed in detail in,  plays the role of a magnetic field in an associated two-dimensional model, and  plays the role of a Fourier parameter of the second lattice dimension. We shall nevertheless stick with the standard nomenclature in dynamical systems and call  the frequency and  the phase and refer to  and  as coupling constants, as they determine the \"strength\" of the shift and the coin, respectively.\n\nThe UAMO displays a metal-insulator phase transition with respect to the coupling constants for almost all  and : for  the spectrum of  is purely absolutely continuous, for  it is purely singular continuous while for  it is pure point with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions(Note that in certain regimes, the \"almost all\" can be lifted to \"all\", for details see.).

The dry version of the problem remains open.\nIn the non-critical setting, the Dry Ten Martini problem for non-Diophantine  is notoriously hard. For the critical AMO with Liouville frequencies, this was proved in by employing the particular structure and symmetries of the operator. The more involved structure of the UAMO seems to render impossible an adaption of the argument in. We nevertheless expect the DTMP to hold for all frequencies, see for a possible attack strategy.\nWe combine Avila's almost reducible theorem with Eliasson's reducibility for Diophantine frequencies to obtain the global reducibility except for the critical case. Therefore, this treatment does not cover the Liouville frequencies.\nThis is the first time a DTMP is showed for (GE)CMV matrices. Some results in Baire category for certain classes of almost periodic extended CMV matrices were previously obtained by. It is an open question whether it holds for other CMV matrices with, for example, subshift or Sturmian Verblunsky coefficients.\n\nWe base our proof on the recent understanding of Anderson localization for Diophantine frequencies obtained in and techniques developed therein:\nthe Anderson localization for the UAMO in the supercritical setting  proved in is a full measure result.
